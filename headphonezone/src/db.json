That's not all, these in-ear earphones are known to be the world leader for response accuracy when compared to other earphones. Therefore even after years, these reference-quality headphones are preferred by audiophiles, musicians and audio engineers.EXPERIENCE NOISE ISOLATION LIKE NEVER BEFORE\n\n\nThese are the first earphones to provide a completely sealed in-ear fit. They offer 98% (35dB - 42dB) noise isolation which is best when compared to any earphones available in the market.

There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you don’t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\n\n\n2PIN CONNECTOR WITH DETACHABLE CABLE ALLOWING FOR UPGRADABILITY\n\n\nThe design for the KZ ZSN Pro X is carefully engineered, featuring a 2PIN connector and detachable cables. The detachable nature of the cable allows the earphones to be able to attach to different cable accessories. KZ ZSN PRO X supports the additional Bluetooth module and can be easily upgraded to a wireless headset.\nFEATURING ALLOY-SHELL DESIGN WHICH GIVES A STUNNING LOOK TO YOUR KZ ZSN PRO X\n\n\nThe streamlined metal and resin design gives a strikingly unique look to your KZ ZSN Pro X.

Super smooth and detailed sound, a nice wide sound stage, and enough punch to make any music sound fun. A single Dynamic driver is not to be discounted. They're very capable.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru \n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nFEATURING FLAGSHIP-LEVEL DYNAMIC DRIVER WITH 1.5 TESLA MAGNETIC FLUX AND JAPANESE VOICE COIL\n\n\nFiiO FD3 Pro continues in the direction of its FD line siblings in using the flagship-grade 12mm dynamic driver. The inside of the FD3 Pro shell is embedded with a driver with a robust magnet of 1.5 Tesla magnetic flux, paired with an ultra-fine copper-clad aluminium Japanese Daikoku voice coil for accurate sound reproduction.ULTRA-MODERN DLC DIAPHRAGM AND ACOUSTIC PRISM SYSTEM FOR LOW DISTORTION AND SUPERIOR CLARITY\n\n\nFlag-ship grade components have been used in the design of the FiiO FD3 Pro. The diaphragm is made of diamond-like carbon (DLC) which is rigid and surprisingly light. This design decision makes the FD3 Pro comfortable to wear and also reduce unwanted distortion having a tremendous transient response. The FD3 Pro’s are further enhanced with the acoustic prism system which brings numerous benefits such as eliminating high frequency standing waves, enhancing overall sound wave diffusion and even effectively solving the problem of time delay caused by sound wave propagation path in the cavity. This all leads to amazing sound quality.COMES WITH EXCLUSIVE HIGH PURITY LITZ CABLE AND HI-RES AUDIO CERTIFICATION\n\n\nFiiO FD3 Pro comes with a carefully engineered cable that enhances the listening experience. The FD3 Pro comes with an exclusive cable made of high purity monocrystalline silver-plated copper cable with 8 strands of 19 wires each for a total of 152 wires braided together in Litz type 2 style. In addition, the cable features blue (left) and red (right) markings for convenience as well as interchangeable audio plugs, allowing you to switch between 2.5/3.5/4.4mm plugs depending on your source. The cable features an MMCX connector for connectivity. This reproduces music vividly and with superior clarity. The FD3 Pro is a Hi-Res Audio certified earphone and is capable of reproducing delicate details.\n\nINDUSTRIAL GRADE ALUMINUM-MAGNESIUM ALLOY BODY FUSED WITH A SEMI-OPEN DESIGN\n\n\nHigh-quality craftsmanship is the primary goal at FiiO and this is reflected in the FD3 Pro unmistakably. The main body is made of aluminium-magnesium alloy in an industrial process combining five-axis CNC processing and hand polishing. This makes the body durable and super elegant to look at. The FD3 Pro features a semi-open design that is based on the company’s patented technology for balanced air pressure. This semi-open design provides a natural sound and also effectively protects your hearing by balancing air pressure within the body and leads to less pressure on your eardrums. This enhances the listening experience tenfold, making the sound less forced.\nPERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN FORM AND FUNCTION\n\n\nThe look of the FiiO FD3 Pro is based on the theme of curves and is simple yet has a beautiful appearance. This is visible in the unique celluloid panel which is covered with 2.5D film coating glass for a Pure transparent look. The FD3 Pro also features interchangeable sound tubes for customising the frequency response of the earphone. How this works is, while the outer diameter of the sound tubes is the same, the inner diameter differs for each sound tube. The large inner diameter tube (black) produces detailed treble, and the small inner diameter tube (red) gives robustness. This is a truly unique approach and is the perfect balance of form and function.SPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n12mm\n\n\nDRIVERS\nDynamic\n\n\nDIAPHRAGM MATERIAL\nDiamond-Like Carbon diaphragm\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz ~ 40kHz\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ω@1kHz\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB@1mW\n\n\nMAX POWER\n100mW\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm/4.4mm/2.5mm Plug\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\n\nCONNECTOR\nMMCX\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-the-ear\n\n\nDETACHABLE CABLE\nYes\n\n\nCABLE\n8-stranded high-purity monocrystalline copper cable\n\n\nCABLE LENGTH\nAbout 120cm\n\n\nWEIGHT\n7.0g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The small hole in the front cavity is used to relieve air pressure. It can help to moderate pressures that happen to the ear canal when putting the FD3 Pro inside the ears. If the front hole is blocked, it would enhance the bass performance. However, hearing fatigue would also be caused easily due to increasing pressures in the ear canal. 2. The diaphragm of the FD3 Pro is made of Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC). Therefore, if the front pressure-relief hole is blocked, it will cause unneeded distortion due to slight transformation of the diaphragm when it is vibrating. [Semi-open acoustic design] The semi-open acoustic design of the FD3 based on FiiO's patented technology for balanced air pressure within brings several advantages. Not only does such a design lead to more natural sound, but it also effectively protects your hearing by balancing air pressure within the cavity, leading to less pressure on your eardrums. This makes your listening experience less tiring and the sound less forced. [Front acoustic prism] The acoustic prism so effectively used in the flagship FD5 for great sound quality is also featured in the FD3 Pro. Like with the FD5, the acoustic prism system brings numerous benefits such as eliminating high frequency standing waves, enhancing overall sound wave diffusion, and even effectively solving the problem of time delay caused by sound wave propagation path in the cavity. This all leads to marvelous sound quality that will surely take your breath away.\n\nHow to distinguish between the left and right channels? \n\nLeft/L: blue  Right/R: red The FiiO FD3 Pro has unit markers on both earphone units: blue L on the left channel and red R on the right. Other than the letter marker, there are corresponding colors at the position of the MMCX connectors, left blue and right red. Please fit the correct channel according to the indication markers when changing the cable.\n\n\nWarranty\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this FiiO FD3 Pro comes with a 1 year warranty from FiiO that covers manufacturing defects.

It has high rigidity, a high damping coefficient, and is extremely lightweight. Its comprehensive acoustic performance even exceeds that of a beryllium diaphragm. This in conjunction with the ULT drivers delivers precise audio reproduction.FEATURING THE NEW 3RD GEN ACOUSTIC FILTER AND A INTERCHANGEABLE EAR NOZZLE\n\n\nThe Moondrop KATO features some of the company’s latest innovations in terms of design and build. Moondrop KATO comes with a brand-new third-generation patented anti-blocking filter integrated on the ear nozzle. It prevents oily ear wax from blocking the filters and is more conducive to mid and high-frequency sound. In addition to this, Moondrop has designed KATO with a replaceable ear nozzle design. They have included two sets of sound nozzles in the package, made with different materials(Steel & Brass). Both the Steel and Brass provide different characteristics to the sound, users can switch between them easily. The nozzle can easily be replaced by a quick-release structure with a screw\nPROFESSIONALLY DESIGNED SHELLS TUNED FOLLOWING VDSF TARGET RESPONSE\n\n\nThe team of acoustic engineers at Moondrop have gone to lengths to deliver an accurate sounding earphone. To achieve this the front acoustic cavity of the Moondrop KATO is designed with the help of volume and structure simulated by FEA (Finite Element Analysis simulation). It’s designed in such a manner to maintain a balanced tuning profile with a sound that will complement different genres well. Combined with the high-frequency phase guide components on the driver, the front cavity arrangement in KATO is superior to other so-called special tuning components. The pair is tuned by professional acoustic engineers following the VDSF target response.\n\n\n\nEXQUISITELY DESIGNED SHELLS WITH A THREE DIMENSIONAL LOOK\n\n\nThe Moondrop KATO has been designed with utmost precision and delivers a stunning visual aesthetic. Moondrop has designed KATO with a modern design using MIM Stainless Steel material. MIM is a process by which powdered metal is mixed with a binder to form a resin in the desired shape and applying high-temperature sintering to achieve the form. There is a high degree of freedom in moulding the resin into the same shape as the cast, making it possible to achieve a complex internal design even with metal. The earphone shell is cast by the MIM powder metallurgy process. Every section of the surface is made smooth by a manual grinding process.\nBUNDLED WITH THE NEWLY DEVELOPED SPRING SILICONE EAR TIPS\n\n\nThe Moondrop KATO features ear tips that are designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. Moondrop KATO comes bundled with the newly developed Spring Tips, which suppresses weak resonance through special diffusion structure and significantly lowers the high-frequency linear distortion caused by nozzle resonance, making the high-frequency timbre more natural. In addition to this, the ear tips offer a snug fit and sit comfortably in the ear canal without being sticky. The ear tips feature a special reinforcing rib support design to prevent bass loss caused by sound leakage.HIGH-QUALITY CABLE WITH 2-PIN CONNECTOR AND GOLD PLATED PINS\n\n\nThe Moondrop KATO comes with a high-quality thick silver-plated copper cable. This cable has been coated with high-permeability mixed material which provides an ultra-low dielectric coefficient. The cable provides smooth signal transmission with low internal resistance ensuring a pure sound output for the users. The cable has a standard 0.78mm 2-pin connector allowing for upgradability and replacement. The pins for the cable have been gold plated to offer a clean audio signal.\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\n10mm-ULT Dynamic Driver\n\n\nDISTORTION\n< 0.15% (@1khz, AES17 20khz, A-weight)\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ω±15% (@1KHz)\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n123dB/Nrms (@1KHz)\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz-45kHz (IEC61094, Free Field)\n\n\nEFFECTIVE FR\n20Hz-20kHz (IEC60318-4, -3dB)\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nEARPHONE INTERFACE\n0.78-2Pin sunken design\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nHOUSING\nMIM Stainless steel\n\n\nNOZZLE\nStainless steel *2, Brass *2\n\n\nCABLE\nSilver Plated Copper Wire 4N-OFC with 0.78-2Pin\n\n\nDIAPHRAGM\nThe 3rd generation DLC Composite Diaphragm\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The added layer of glitters resembles stars and the colour alters when viewed from different angles. Even the cables paired with the Starfield come with a layer of glitter on them to complement the overall cosmic-inspired design.A CARBON NANOTUBE ARRAY AND GOLD-PLATED BRASS CHAMBER FOR A LIFE-LIKE REAL SOUND\n\n\nMerging carbon nanotube arrays and PET membranes, the Strafield features an applied technology for an excellent sonic performance. The 6um (0.006mm) diaphragm used in the Starfield comes with advanced durability while delivering an airy sound and analytical highs. The gold-plated brass inner chamber used in the Starfield increases the air damping of the diaphragm. This allows you to enjoy a balanced sound with a smoother transition across the audio spectrum.A WELL-BALANCED SOUND WITH ENHANCED ACOUSTICS FOR BETTER MUSICALITY\n\n\nThe sound of the Starfield finds its strength from its unique acoustical measurements that deliver an enhanced frequency response and ultra-low level distortion. Taking inspiration from the flagship KXXS, the Starfield offers warmer and softer timbre. However, the sound of the Starfield is unique with the focus on a subtle and detailed sound. It finds the right balance between neutrality and musicality. The magnet structure used in the Starfield is paired with a Daikoku CCAW coil that produces a dynamic range and an optimum transient response. This is where the Starfield gets its analytical and lively sound.WITH 24AWG OFC LITZ CABLE AND A 0.78MM 2PIN SOCKET FOR SEAMLESS CONNECTIVITY\n\n\nMaintaining the purity and intricacies of the dynamic sound, the MOONDROP Starfield sports a 24AWG OFC Litz copper cable. To go with the overall theme of the Starfield, glitters have been added to the outer insulation of the cable. The Starfield comes with a standard 0.78mm 2pin socket. You can always replace these cables to get a more personalised music listening experience.\n\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\nCarbon Nanotube diaphragm- 10mm Dual cavity dynamic driver\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ω±15%（@1kHz）\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n122dB/Vrms(@1kHz)\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n10Hz-36000Hz(Free Field. 1/4\"MIC,-3dB)\n\n\nEFFECTIVE FR\n20Hz-20000Hz(IEC60318-4)\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5 mm Line Type\n\n\nEARPHONE INTERFACE\n0.78mm 2 pin\n\n\nMIC & REMOTE\nNA\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nCABLE\n24AWG Litz 4N OFC\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

This diaphragm with a high damping factor is paired with an ultra-lightweight CCAW low impedance coil and an N52 external magnet circuit.\nA BASS ENHANCED NATURAL SOUND FOR AN ENERGETIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE\n\n\nWhile the overall sound signature of the Moondrop SSP remains neutral, the bass is slightly enhanced for a pleasant listening experience. This enhancement is done with respect to the Diffuse field Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) and does not affect the soundstage. Materials used to change the density of the 4 dampers of this headphone results in a natural yet energetic sound.\nCOMPACT IN-EAR MONITORS DESIGNED FOR TOTAL COMFORT & DURABILITY\n\n\nFeaturing compact transducers and integrated internal structure, the Moondrop SSP sports a simple design. The IEMs are designed to offer a comfortable in-ear fit for security and optimum music listening.

These IEMs have an imported Daikoku-φ0.035mm CCAW voice coil which makes your music sound more transparent and natural.\n\n\n\nUNRIVALLED FREQUENCY RESPONSE FOR EXCELLENT RECORDING PERFORMANCE\n\n\nThe Aria sports a composite sound cavity, multiple tuning holes, and multiple acoustic damping ensuring precise frequency response and excellent sonic performance of the driver unit. In compliance with the HRTF (head-related transfer function) and room response function, the frequency response of the Aria is optimized for modern recording. With an extended vertical sound field and ample atmosphere, the Moondrop Aria is a perfect IEM for excellent recording performance. The high-frequency phase interference often causes distortion and to make sure that doesn't happen, the Aria has a newly designed high-frequency phase waveguide making treble more delicate and natural.INTRICATE ERGONOMIC DESIGN AND AN UPGRADEABLE SILVER-PLATED CABLE\n\n\nThe high-grade metal cavity of the Moondrop Aria is a result of complex processes including Metal injection, moulding CNC carved processing and matte metal spray. These ergonomically and aesthetically designed IEMs are an elegant and moving piece of art. The Moondrop Aria is paired with a replaceable silver-plated and nylon braided cable. It has a universal 0.78 2-pin interface. You can always replace this cable with a cable-with-mic, a Bluetooth cable or a high-grade balanced cable for even better sound.

It does have small amount of bleed,but not enough to mask the lower mids. \"\nRead More\n\n\n \n\"I personally like Aria’s looks more than its older sibling Starfield as well as KXXS. Aria has a similar shell shape to KXXS but is a bit smaller and has slightly less shell depth in comparison.\"\nRead More\n \n\"The Aria offers healthy amounts of rumble and slam for the average listener, though both bassheads and neutrality purists may be disappointed by what has become the consensus bass tuning for IEMs. \"\nRead More\n\n\n \n\"Moondrop Aria has been hot stuff for a while and rightfully so. I’ve been listening to it now for over a month and my impressions have drastically evolved since the first listen till now.\"\nRead More\n\n\n \n\"It feels premium & comfortable in my ears. The cable hooks were also the right amount of sturdiness & flexibility which makes sure the IEMs do not fall off when you move around.\"\nRead More\n \n\"Aria has a balanced sound with a subtle lift in the bass, upper midrange and lower treble. The overall tonality is U-shaped with some added warmth from the boosted bass response.\"\nRead More\n\n\n \n\"I find treble on the Aria impressive. It is airy and open, with a lot of sparkle that is quite pleasant and which offers a good counterbalance to bass. Extension is quite good as well. \"\nRead More\n\n\n \n\"The Moondrop Aria is an extremely solid IEM that is worth well beyond its price.

This design also provides a comfortable fit to the users for longer listening sessions.RICH, FULL SOUND WITH SPECIALLY TUNED 6mm MICRO DYNAMIC DRIVER\n\n\nMoondrop Quarks earphone features a 6mm micro dynamic driver that is highly capable of sound reproduction. This driver benefits from an external N52 neodymium magnetic architecture, a high-quality polymer diaphragm coil, and an imported CCAW voice coil. This provides excellent dynamics and lowers nonlinear distortion. The drivers are specially designed and tuned for a neutral tone and are easy to drive. It reproduces a rich sound with balanced frequency response. These earphones are sure to suit your music with their high-resolution clarity.TUNED FOLLOWING THE HEAD RELATED TRANSFER FUNCTION (HRTF) FREQUENCY RESPONSE CURVE\n\n\nThe Moondrop Quarks earphones have been specifically tuned by experts at the company. The tuning adjustment took over two years to achieve their preferred sound signature - which is a neutral & natural sounding tuning following the Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) frequency response curve. The earphones have a wide frequency response range of 4Hz-43kHz allowing you to enjoy music with clarity.\n\n\nPATENTED SOUND DAMPING STRUCTURE WITH DOUBLE-DAMPING\n\n\nMoondrop Quarks earphones adopt the second generation patented anti-blocking sound damping structure in order to maintain high-resolution performance. This also helps in improving the durability of the earphones and reduces blockage caused in the nozzle area due to earwax buildup. Moondrop has designed a double-damping structure using two different materials with completely different acoustic resistance to filter different frequencies. This enhances the sound by greatly eliminating treble ringing and making the sound natural and enjoyable.INDUSTRIAL DESIGN WITH TRANSPARENT SHELL\n\n\nMoondrop Quarks earphones feature a unique structural design that is revealing. The shells of the earphones are fully transparent and are compact in size for a comfortable wearing experience. The transparent cavity allows for a clear view of the driver and acoustic structure.

You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.DESCRIPTION\n\n\nFEATURING AN ALL-NEW SEMI-DEEP IN-EAR DESIGN FOR AN IMPROVED SOUND\n\n\nWith one-of-its-kind semi in-ear design, the MOONDROP Spaceship delivers a more natural high-frequency performance and a reduced HF attenuation and resonance. This semi in-ear design offers a comfortable wearing experience along with better restrain of the HF performance in comparison to regular earphones.METICULOUSLY TESTED BALANCED SOUND FOR SONIC EXCELLENCE\n\n\nAfter a four-month-long sample adjustment process, MOONDROP came up with a VDSF Target Response based index design and a diaphragm design based on the auditory feedback of multiple users. The SPACESHIP is an entry-level in-ear earphone but goes way beyond its limits to display MOONDROP's pursuit of sound.\n\n\n\nA SIMPLE YET DURABLE DESIGN WITH AN ECM MICROPHONE AND A PLAYBACK CONTROL BUTTON\n\n\nYou get to experience the best possible audio input with a back-pole ECM microphone used in the MOONDROP SPACESHIP.

Adopting cutting edge technology with high attention to detail and the highest quality of audio design, Final has carved a name for itself amongst audiophiles winning multiple awards over the years.      CREATING VALUABLE ANTIQUES, NOT JUST PRODUCTS\n\n\nThe team at Final strongly believes in creating earphones and headphones that are highly revered by people. Final earphones, like Swiss wristwatches and German Cars must be built to last forever and used as valuable antiques. The result of such careful consideration is a long-lasting, rational & emotionally valuable asset with the best sound quality and best design.\n\n\n\nCRAFTED IN KAWASAKI, JAPAN SINCE 1974\n\n\nAt the Final factory, the team of audio designers are dedicated to innovating audio products through research. Unlike other OEM manufacturers, they believe in designing their products in-house. This facilitates internal feedback between various teams and departments, encouraging the process for developing a long lasting product.\n\n\n\nA PROUD SHOWCASE OF JAPANESE HERITAGE AND CRAFTSMANSHIP\n\n\nFinal has a state-of-the-art company-owned “Final Store” located in Tokyo, Japan. This is open to all music lovers and audio enthusiasts to come in and experience Final’s range of headphones & earphones. The store proudly showcases their Japanese heritage and cultural artefacts in the form of Samurai suits. This represents Final's deep respect for the audio purist.\nSINGLE BALANCED ARMATURE DRIVER DELIVERING PRECISE AUDIO\n\n\nThe team at Final spared no effort in terms of engineering and designing the B2. This in-ear monitor features a new and redesigned driver setup that delivers high-quality, precise sound. The B2 features a single balanced armature driver to deliver a natural sound that’s crisp and clear. The implementation of this driver enabled a particular emphasis on proximity of sound and sense of reality. With this balanced armature driver setup, you experience vocals in a manner that the respiration of the singer can be felt. It is also capable of reproducing the nuance and inflexion of the delicate sound of each musical instrument.\nAWARD WINNING DESIGN FOR LIFELONG USE WITH REPAIRABLE CONSTRUCTION\n\n\nThe B2 from Final is designed with modular elements which allow disassembly and easy repairs. This design has been implemented keeping in mind the factor of being able to use the IEM’s for a long time and if any issue arises, can solve it with ease. The B2 features a design where the front and rear pieces of the housing shell are detachable making it easy to open and inspect the earphone for any issue. This design allows for repairs and extends the lifetime of the earphones. The housing components can be disassembled with screws ensuring that the product can be used for many years after purchase. With this future proof design and the technology embedded in the Final B2, they have been awarded at the VGP 2019 SUMMER awards in Japan.\nERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED CHASSIS OFFERING A CUSTOMISED WEARING EXPERIENCE\n\n\nThe design for the chassis of the Final B2 has been completely reimagined and re-engineered to offer utmost comfort. Unlike most IEMs on the market, which are designed with an ergonomic shape that rests heavily on the ear and silicone ear tips to keep them in place, the B2 limits the area that comes in contact with the ear, aiming to achieve a sense of fit with no feeling of oppression. The featured chassis is designed with 2 holding positions and 1 assisting position to offer a secure fit. In simpler words, it limits the amount of contact between the housing and the ear. This makes it comfortable and ensures a stable fit for a variety of people.\nDURABLE METAL INJECTION MOULDING STAINLESS STEEL HOUSING\n\n\nThe Final B2 is made with premium quality materials and the utmost attention to detail for preferable results. The housing of the B2 is made of Metal Injection Moulding stainless steel with a matt finish instead of traditional aluminium. MIM is a process by which powdered metal is mixed with a binder to form a resin in the desired shape and applying high-temperature sintering to achieve the form. There is a high degree of freedom in moulding the resin into the same shape as the cast, making it possible to achieve a complex internal design even with metal. This decision was implemented as stainless steel is highly resistant to magnetism and has a high specific gravity, favourable for making the IEMs. These design decisions and selected materials are contributing elements enhancing the sound quality of the earphones.\n\n\n\nHIGH-QUALITY ORIGINAL OFC CABLE WITH MMCX CONNECTOR\n\n\nFinal B2 comes with an original OFC cable that provides a wide soundstage. These cables are developed to deliver fast signal transmission. The outer layer is coated with maximum flexibility. You will experience surprising flexibility that both makes the cable extremely easy to use as well as reducing the likelihood of microphonics. In addition, the earphones feature an MMCX plug and the 3.5mm mini-plug which are gold plated for better transmission. This durable cable and connector make connecting to a source device easy and seamless.\n\n\n\nBUNDLED WITH HIGH-QUALITY EAR HOOKS FOR ELIMINATING TOUCH NOISE\n\n\nThe Final B2 comes bundled with premium quality ear hooks that are carefully designed to fit everyone. The team at Final, considered the key aspects to designing an ear hook that is comfortable to wear and discovered a form that was smaller than most existing ear hooks and that didn't utilise metal or resin wires. This decision allowed for a simmer ear hook and one that feels premium to the touch, allowing the user to wear the earphones for extended periods and enjoy their music. This design drastically suppresses touch noise when the connecting cable touches the body.\n\n\n\nHIGH-QUALITY SILICONE EAR-TIPS AND CASE INCLUDED\n\n\nThe ear tips for the Final B2 have been designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. These come in 5 sizes and the right and left earbuds have different coloured markings for easy recognisability and the different sizes also ensure that the sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum. Two types of silicon differing in rigidity are employed for the sound conduit and for the earbud that comes into contact with the user’s ear. The silicon used for the sound conduit is more rigid than that used for the earbud, and having groove processing applied to it, combines both strength and flexibility. These earphones also come bundled with a silicone carry case. With this silicon carry case, the cables can be rolled up and stored easily. The earphones themselves are gently secured using thin dome-shaped silicon covers making them perfect to carry along with you.\n\n\n\nENGINEERED TO SOUND STUNNING WITH REGULAR USE\n\n\nThe Final B2 comes embedded with driver units with a diaphragm attached to a voice coil and adhesive agent. With audio signals flowing, the diaphragm moves in minute increments along with the voice coil allowing the sound to be produced. Over time, the diaphragm moves efficiently and the sound changes or ‘ages’. The B2 has a small aperture, and so an extended period is necessary for changes through ageing to become noticeable. When used for over 150-200 hours, it should feel as though the sound has become stable. Favourable outcomes can be obtained through the ageing of the product, by listening to the music you normally listen to at a volume you usually listen to.\n\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\n1 Balanced Armature driver\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n109dB\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n41Ω\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nCONNECTOR\nMMCX\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nNA\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nHOUSING\nStainless Steel (Gunmetal finish)\n\n\nCABLE\nOFC Black Cable\n\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n1.2ｍ\n\n\nDETACHABLE CABLE\nYes\n\n\nWEIGHT\n32g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n1.

Adopting cutting edge technology with high attention to detail and the highest quality of audio design, Final has carved a name for itself amongst audiophiles winning multiple awards over the years.      CREATING VALUABLE ANTIQUES, NOT JUST PRODUCTS\n\n\nThe team at Final strongly believes in creating earphones and headphones that are highly revered by people. Final earphones, like Swiss wristwatches and German Cars must be built to last forever and used as valuable antiques. The result of such careful consideration is a long-lasting, rational & emotionally valuable asset with the best sound quality and best design.\n\n\n\nCRAFTED IN KAWASAKI, JAPAN SINCE 1974\n\n\nAt the Final factory, the team of audio designers are dedicated to innovating audio products through research. Unlike other OEM manufacturers, they believe in designing their products in-house. This facilitates internal feedback between various teams and departments, encouraging the process for developing a long lasting product.\n\n\n\nA PROUD SHOWCASE OF JAPANESE HERITAGE AND CRAFTSMANSHIP\n\n\nFinal has a state-of-the-art company-owned “Final Store” located in Tokyo, Japan. This is open to all music lovers and audio enthusiasts to come in and experience Final’s range of headphones & earphones. The store proudly showcases their Japanese heritage and cultural artefacts. This represents Final's deep respect for the audio purist.\n\n6.4MMφ DYNAMIC DRIVER UNIT DELIVERING PRECISE SPATIAL AUDIO EXPERIENCE\n\n\nFinal E500 features a powerful yet small-aperture 6.4mm diameter dynamic driver that has been precisely assembled to deliver cutting-edge audio quality. With this dynamic driver, you experience high-resolution audio with the frequency ranges tuned to deliver clean audio without masking any of the sounds for smooth and vivid audio. The Final E500 is designed to be combined with virtual reality and gaming consoles. The Final E500 delivers a natural spatial sound with a concentrated sense of direction.SWING-FITTING EARPIECE MECHANISM AND PRECISION MACHINED HOUSING\n\n\nThe Final E500 features a unique swing-fit mechanism, allowing the earpiece to be able to move left and right and tilt towards the audio canal for a perfect fit. These prevent changes in shape owing to the aperture of the earpiece coming into contact with the auditory canal. The sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum, delivering clear sound. The sound conduit uses rigid silicone with a groove processing that combines strength and flexibility. The Final E500 is made from highly resilient ABS thermoplastic polymer material that is lightweight, robust while diminishing vibrations that would distort the sound. The simple housing of the final E500 can stand daily use while keeping in line with the design philosophy of final earphones.\n\n5 INTERCHANGEABLE EAR-TIPS INCLUDED FOR ALL USERS\n\n\nThe ear tips for the Final E500 have been designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. These come in 5 sizes and ensure that the sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum. Two types of silicon differing in rigidity are employed for the sound conduit and for the earbud that comes into contact with the user’s ear. The silicon used for the sound conduit is more rigid than that used for the earbud, and having groove processing applied to it, combines both strength and flexibility.\n\n\nENGINEERED TO SOUND STUNNING WITH REGULAR USE\n\n\nThe Final E500 comes embedded with driver units with a diaphragm attached to a voice coil and adhesive agent. With audio signals flowing, the diaphragm moves in minute increments along with the voice coil and sound is produced. Over time, the diaphragm moves efficiently and the sound changes or ‘ages’. The E500 has a small aperture, and so an extended period is necessary for changes through ageing to become noticeable. When used over 150-200 hours, it should feel as though the sound has become stable. Favourable outcomes can be obtained through the ageing of the product by listening to the music you listen to at a volume you usually prefer.\n\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\n6.4mm Small-Aperture Dynamic Drivers\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n98dB\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n16Ω\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nNA\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nHOUSING\nABS\n\n\nCABLE\nOFC Black Cable\n\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n1.2m\n\n\nWEIGHT\n15g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Spread peace, not sweat.\n\n\nUSER MANUAL\nHOW TO WEAR THE EARPHONES\nCheck the left and right with the L (left) and R (right) indications on the side of the housing. In addition, the earpiece that is attached to the main body as standard is R (right) when the shaft color is red. Also, refer to the earpiece swing fit mechanism and adjust the angle so that it fits smoothly in your ear when worn. Hold the body and push it in with a slight twist to attach it to both ears. The sound quality changes greatly depending on the mounting position, so move the main unit three-dimensionally one by one while playing music to adjust it to the most preferable listening position. That is the optimum position (best position). Once you experience it, you can easily align it from the second time.\n\n\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Final E500 comes with a 1 year warranty from Final that covers manufacturing defects.

This is open to all music lovers and audio enthusiasts to come in and experience Final’s range of headphones & earphones. The store proudly showcases their Japanese heritage and cultural artefacts. This represents Final's deep respect for the audio purist.\n6.4MMφ DYNAMIC DRIVER UNIT DELIVER AWARD WINNING PERFORMANCE\n\n\nFinal E2000, E2000C and E2000CS feature a powerful yet small-aperture 6.4mm diameter dynamic driver that has been precisely assembled to deliver pristine audio quality. The precision involved in assembling the parts for the driver unit is of the utmost importance. With this dynamic driver, you experience clear audio with all the frequency ranges tuned to deliver clean sound without masking any of the sounds. The Final E2000, E2000C and E2000CS are tuned incorporating the latest in acoustic engineering and psychoacoustics technology gained through the team's research and development efforts. With the combination of the technology embedded in these earphones, they surpass many competing earphones and have been awarded the Gold Prize at the VGP 2019 SUMMER awards in Japan.SWING-FITTING EARPIECE MECHANISM FOR COMFORT, DURABILITY & FLEXIBILITY\n\n\nThe Final E2000, E2000C and E2000CS have been designed to provide utmost comfort and durability. Featuring a unique swing-fit mechanism allowing the earpiece to be able to move left and right and tilt towards the audio canal for a perfect fit. These prevent changes in shape owing to the aperture of the earpiece coming into contact with the auditory canal. The sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum, delivering clear sound.\n\nSTURDY ALUMINIUM HOUSING FUSED WITH STAINLESS STEEL MESH BACK\n\n\nThe Final E2000, E2000C and E2000CS are made with quality materials and precision. The housing for the earpiece is made out of machined aluminium with an alumite finish to support the driver unit and suppress any unnecessary vibrations. To further elevate the effect of the housing, it has a shape that has been designed in a manner to fit most ears. The back of the housing features an aperture that acts to extend low-frequency reproduction while enhancing isolation. The aperture is made of stainless steel material and features a filter inside to prevent sound leakage.\n\n\n\nE2000C AND E2000CS EMBEDDED WITH MICROPHONE AND IN-LINE CONTROLS\n\n\nThe included cable with the Final E2000C and E2000CS features a quality microphone to receive calls and for communication. This microphone is a high-quality mic capable of transmitting clean audio. There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you don’t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\nENGINEERED TO SOUND STUNNING WITH REGULAR USE\n\n\nThe Final E2000, E2000C and E2000CS come embedded with driver units with a diaphragm attached to a voice coil and adhesive agent. With audio signals flowing, the diaphragm moves in minute increments along with the voice coil allowing the sound to be produced. Over time, the diaphragm moves efficiently and the sound changes or ‘ages’. The E2000, E2000C and E200CS have a small aperture, and so an extended period is necessary for changes through ageing to become noticeable. When used for over 150-200 hours, it should feel as though the sound has become stable. Favourable outcomes can be obtained through the ageing of the product, by listening to the music you normally listen to at a volume you usually listen to.\n\n\n\nHIGH-QUALITY OFC CABLE CAPABLE OF SUPPRESSING TOUCH NOISE\n\n\nFinal E2000, E2000C and E2000CS employs a thick and flexible cable to prevent breakage and tangling whilst using the earphones. The cable is made of rubber and coated to extend its life. E2000, E2000C and E200CS use a more flexible OFC (oxygen-free copper) cable to transmit better audio signal from a device to the earbuds. This design drastically suppresses touch noise when the connecting cable touches the body. It features a Y split point and an L-shaped jack to further solidify the durability. This durable cable and connector make connecting to a source device easy and seamless.\n\n\n\nBUNDLED WITH HIGH-QUALITY EAR HOOKS FOR A COMFORTABLE WEARING EXPERIENCE\n\n\nThe E2000, E2000C and E2000CS come bundled with premium quality ear hooks that are carefully designed to fit everyone. The team at Final considered the key aspects to designing an ear hook that was comfortable to wear and discovered a form that was smaller than most existing ear hooks and that didn't utilize metal or resin wires. This decision allowed for a slimmer ear hook and one that feels premium to the touch, allowing the user to wear the earphones for extended periods and enjoy their music. 5 INTERCHANGEABLE EAR-TIPS AND CARRY POUCH INCLUDED FOR ALL USERS\n\n\nThe ear tips for the Final E2000, E2000C and E2000CS have been designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. These come in 5 sizes and ensure that the sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum. Two types of silicon differing in rigidity are employed for the sound conduit and for the earbud that comes into contact with the user’s ear.

There's a reason that the E3000 has been voted best beginner IEM for six years in a row. The shiny metal earbuds are built like a tank. And its versatile balanced sound signature has a lot more bass than the E1000 and E2000.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru \n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away.

Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nTHE PINNACLE OF CUTTING-EDGE JAPANESE ENGINEERING\n\n\nFinal makes use of high precision Japanese engineering with focus on finesse and accuracy. Adopting cutting edge technology with high attention to detail and the highest quality of audio design, Final has carved a name for itself amongst audiophiles winning multiple awards over the years.      CREATING VALUABLE ANTIQUES, NOT JUST PRODUCTS\n\n\nThe team at Final strongly believes in creating earphones and headphones that are highly revered by people. Final earphones, like Swiss wristwatches and German Cars must be built to last forever and used as valuable antiques. The result of such careful consideration is a long-lasting, rational & emotionally valuable asset with the best sound quality and best design.\n\n\n\nCRAFTED IN KAWASAKI, JAPAN SINCE 1974\n\n\nAt the Final factory, the team of audio designers are dedicated to innovating audio products through research. Unlike other OEM manufacturers, they believe in designing their products in-house. This facilitates internal feedback between various teams and departments, encouraging the process for developing a long lasting product.\n\n\n\nA PROUD SHOWCASE OF JAPANESE HERITAGE AND CRAFTSMANSHIP\n\n\nFinal has a state-of-the-art company-owned “Final Store” located in Tokyo, Japan. This is open to all music lovers and audio enthusiasts to come in and experience Final’s range of headphones & earphones. The store proudly showcases their Japanese heritage and cultural artefacts. This represents Final's deep respect for the audio purist.\n6.4MMφ DYNAMIC DRIVER UNIT DELIVER AWARD WINNING PERFORMANCE\n\n\nFinal E3000 and E3000C features a powerful yet small-aperture 6.4mm diameter dynamic driver that has been precisely assembled to deliver pristine audio quality. The precision involved in the assembling process for the driver unit is given the utmost importance. With this dynamic driver, you experience clear audio with all the frequency ranges tuned to deliver a flat sound without any masking. The Final E3000 and E3000C are tuned incorporating the latest in acoustic engineering and psychoacoustics technology gained through the team's research and development efforts. With the combination of the technology embedded in these earphones, they surpass many earphones and have been awarded the Gold Prize at the VGP 2019 SUMMER awards in Japan.UNIQUE SWING-FITTING EARPIECE MECHANISM FOR COMFORT & FLEXIBILITY\n\n\nThe Final E3000 and E3000C have been designed to provide the utmost comfort and durability. Featuring a unique swing-fit mechanism allowing the earpiece to be able to move left and right and tilt towards the audio canal for a perfect fit. These prevent changes in shape owing to the aperture of the earpiece coming into contact with the auditory canal. The sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum, delivering clear sound.\n\nDURABLE STAINLESS STEEL HOUSING FUSED WITH STAINLESS STEEL MESH BACK\n\n\nThe Final E3000 and E3000C are made with premium materials and utmost precision. The housing for the earpiece is made out of highly rigid stainless steel with a mirror finish to support the driver unit and suppress any unnecessary vibrations. This design and selected materials are contributing elements concerning sound quality. This is a design that has a simple shape and a high-quality texture matched with classic sound quality. The back of the housing features an aperture that acts to extend low-frequency reproduction while enhancing isolation. The aperture is made of stainless steel material and features a filter inside to prevent sound leakage.\n\n\n\nE3000C EMBEDDED WITH MICROPHONE AND IN-LINE CONTROLS\n\n\nThe included cable with the Final E3000C features a quality microphone to receive calls and for communication. This microphone is a high-quality mic capable of transmitting clean audio. There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you don’t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\nENGINEERED TO SOUND STUNNING WITH REGULAR USE\n\n\nThe Final E3000 and E3000C come embedded with driver units with a diaphragm attached to a voice coil and adhesive agent. With audio signals flowing, the diaphragm moves in minute increments along with the voice coil allowing the sound to be produced. Over time, the diaphragm moves efficiently and the sound changes or ‘ages’. The E3000 and E3000C have a small aperture, and so an extended period is necessary for changes through ageing to become noticeable. When used for over 150-200 hours, it should feel as though the sound has become stable. Favourable outcomes can be obtained through the ageing of the product, by listening to the music you normally listen to at a volume you usually listen to.\n\n\n\nHIGH-QUALITY OFC CABLE CAPABLE OF SUPPRESSING TOUCH NOISE\n\n\nFinal E3000 and E3000C employ a thick and flexible cable to prevent breakage and tangling whilst using the earphones. The cable is made of rubber and coated to extend its life. E3000 and E3000C use a more flexible OFC (oxygen-free copper) cable to transmit better audio signals from a device to the earbuds. This design drastically suppresses touch noise when the connecting cable touches the body. The earphones feature a Y split point and an L-shaped jack to further solidify the durability. This durable cable and connector make connecting to a source device easy and seamless.\n\n\n\nBUNDLED WITH HIGH-QUALITY EAR HOOKS FOR A COMFORTABLE WEARING EXPERIENCE\n\n\nThe E3000 and E3000C come bundled with premium quality ear hooks that are crafted to fit everyone. The team at Final considered the key aspects to designing an ear hook that was comfortable to wear and discovered a form that was smaller than most existing ear hooks and that didn't utilise metal or resin wires. This decision allowed for a slimmer ear hook and one that feels premium to the touch, allowing the user to wear the earphones for extended periods and enjoy their music. 5 INTERCHANGEABLE EAR-TIPS AND CARRY POUCH INCLUDED FOR ALL USERS\n\n\nThe ear tips for the Final E3000 and E3000C have been designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. These come in 5 sizes and ensure that the sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum. Two types of silicon differing in rigidity are employed for the sound conduit and for the earbud that comes into contact with the user’s ear. The silicon used for the sound conduit is more rigid than that used for the earbud, and having groove processing applied to it, combines both strength and flexibility. These earphones also come bundled with a carry case making them perfect to carry along with you.\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\n6.4mmΦ dynamic driver\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n100dB/mW\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n16Ω\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nE3000C - YesE3000 - NA\n\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nHOUSING\nStainless steel mirror-finished\n\n\nCABLE\nOFC cable\n\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n1.2m\n\n\nDETACHABLE CABLE\nNA\n\n\nWEIGHT\nE3000 - 14gE3000C - 15g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nE3000\n1.

An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nTHE PINNACLE OF CUTTING-EDGE JAPANESE ENGINEERING\n\n\nFinal makes use of high precision Japanese engineering with focus on finesse and accuracy. Adopting cutting edge technology with high attention to detail and the highest quality of audio design, Final has carved a name for itself amongst audiophiles winning multiple awards over the years.      CREATING VALUABLE ANTIQUES, NOT JUST PRODUCTS\n\n\nThe team at Final strongly believes in creating earphones and headphones that are highly revered by people. Final earphones, like Swiss wristwatches and German Cars must be built to last forever and used as valuable antiques. The result of such careful consideration is a long-lasting, rational & emotionally valuable asset with the best sound quality and best design.\n\n\n\nCRAFTED IN KAWASAKI, JAPAN SINCE 1974\n\n\nAt the Final factory, the team of audio designers are dedicated to innovating audio products through research. Unlike other OEM manufacturers, they believe in designing their products in-house. This facilitates internal feedback between various teams and departments, encouraging the process for developing a long lasting product.\n\n\n\nA PROUD SHOWCASE OF JAPANESE HERITAGE AND CRAFTSMANSHIP\n\n\nFinal has a state-of-the-art company-owned “Final Store” located in Tokyo, Japan. This is open to all music lovers and audio enthusiasts to come in and experience Final’s range of headphones & earphones. The store proudly showcases their Japanese heritage and cultural artefacts. This represents Final's deep respect for the audio purist.\n6.4MMφ DYNAMIC DRIVER UNIT DELIVERING A CLEAN AUDIO EXPERIENCE\n\n\nFinal E1000 and E1000C feature a powerful yet small-aperture 6.4mm diameter dynamic driver that has been precisely assembled to deliver cutting-edge audio quality. With this dynamic driver you experience high-resolution audio with the frequency ranges tuned to deliver clean audio without masking any of the sounds for smooth and vivid audio. The Final E1000 and E1000C are tuned incorporating the latest in acoustic engineering and psychoacoustics technology gained through the team's research and development efforts.SWING-FITTING EARPIECE MECHANISM FOR COMFORT, DURABILITY & FLEXIBILITY\n\n\nThe Final E1000 and E1000C have been designed to provide utmost comfort and durability. Featuring a unique swing-fit mechanism allowing the earpiece to be able to move left and right and tilt towards the audio canal for a perfect fit. These prevent changes in shape owing to the aperture of the earpiece coming into contact with the auditory canal. The sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum, delivering clear sound.\n\nENGINEERED TO SOUND STUNNING WITH REGULAR USE\n\n\nThe Final E1000 and E1000C come embedded with driver units with a diaphragm attached to a voice coil and adhesive agent. With audio signals flowing, the diaphragm moves in minute increments along with the voice coil and sound is produced. Over time, the diaphragm moves efficiently and the sound changes or ‘ages’. The E1000 and E1000C have a small aperture, and so an extended period is necessary for changes through ageing to become noticeable. When used in a normal way, over 150-200 hours, it should feel as though the sound has become stable. Favourable outcomes can be obtained through the ageing of the product by listening to the music you normally listen to at a volume you usually listen to.\nHIGH QUALITY OFC CABLE AND CONNECTORS FOR CLEAR AUDIO\n\n\nFinal E1000 and E1000C employs a thick and flexible cable to prevent breakage and entangling whilst using the earphones. The featured cable is made of rubber and coated to extend the life of the cable. E1000 uses a more flexible OFC (oxygen-free copper) cable to transmit better audio signal from a device to the earbuds. It features a Y split point and an L-shaped jack to further solidify the durability. This durable cable and connector make connecting to a source device easy and seamless.\n\n\n\n5 INTERCHANGEABLE EAR-TIPS INCLUDED FOR ALL USERS\n\n\nThe ear tips for the Final E1000 and E1000C have been designed from soft silicone for superior comfort and noise isolation. These come in 5 sizes and ensure that the sound is transmitted directly to the eardrum. Two types of silicon differing in rigidity are employed for the sound conduit and for the earbud that comes into contact with the user’s ear. The silicon used for the sound conduit is more rigid than that used for the earbud, and by having groove processing applied to it, combines both strength and flexibility.\n\n\n\nE1000C EMBEDDED WITH MICROPHONE AND IN-LINE CONTROLS\n\n\nThe included cable with the Final E1000C features a quality microphone to receive calls and for communication. This microphone is a high-quality mic capable of transmitting clean audio. There are quick-access functions assigned to the button on the microphone housing and it allows for receiving calls, rejecting calls, playing/pausing music and changing the songs played. This is truly useful as you don’t need to access your devices to execute these frequently used functions.\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVER\n6.4mmΦ Dynamic Driver\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB/mW\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n16Ω\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nE1000C - YesE1000 - NA\n\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\n\nHOUSING\nABS\n\n\nCABLE\nBlack OFC Cable\n\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n1.2m\n\n\nDETACHABLE CABLE\nNA\n\n\nWEIGHT\n15g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nE1000\n1.

Coming as a successor to the award-winning Hifiman Edition X, the latest Edition XS features all-new Neo Super-Nano Diaphragm and Stealth magnet technology. Hifiman Edition XS has been tuned by professionals to deliver a natural and vivid sound reproduction. Edition XS presents you with a surround sound feeling. It leaves you in awe with deep-hitting bass response, lush vocals, energetic treble and a wide 3D soundstage. Enjoy your favourite music with the outstanding Hifiman Edition XS.\n\nPLANAR MAGNETIC DRIVERS FUSED WITH NEO DIAPHRAGM AND STEALTH MAGNET TECH\n\n\nHifiman has mastery in designing and developing full-sized planar magnetic headphones. The latest Edition XS uses a newly developed planar magnetic driver with an ultra-thin diaphragm coil known as Neo super-nano diaphragm. This driver has an impressively fast response resulting in a highly-detailed sound with lower distortion. This new driver works in conjunction with invisible Stealth Magnets, which enables the sound waves to pass through the magnets without generating interference. Hifiman’s advanced magnet design is acoustically transparent, dramatically reducing wave diffraction turbulence that degrades the integrity of the sound waves. The reduced distortion yields pure sonic output that is accurate and full-range.\n\n\nTHE STEALTH MAGNET DESIGN OFFERS LOW IMPEDANCE AND WIDE FREQUENCY RESPONSE\n\n\nHifiman developed the stealth magnet design for their flagship Susvara and has featured the same technology with the latest Edition XS. For this, Hifiman has optimised the air turbulence and reflection of the sound waves inside the driver cavity. This design makes the magnet invisible in front of the sound waves and results in refined audio performance. Aside from improved acoustic performance, the Edition XS has a low impedance of 18Ω, which allows it to be easily driven. The new acoustic architecture also offers a frequency response from 8Hz-50kHz, allowing you to enjoy your music in full fidelity.REDESIGNED WITH NEW HEADBAND AND 3.5MM SOCKETS TO OFFER BETTER COMFORT\n\n\nHifiman has designed a new headband for the Edition XS. This headband is familiar to their recently launched HE400i headphones and offers better comfort and durability. The new headband is lightweight, ergonomically structured to offer maximum comfort for hours of listening pleasure. The exterior is refined matte black material, and the interior features high-grade memory foam for the most comfortable fit and elasticity. The headphone’s structural design supports overall durability that retains its comfortable fit for years of enjoyment. The Edition XS also features new 3.5mm sockets for connectivity which are similar to those found on most common audio devices. The included 3.5mm cable is user changeable and replaceable.\n\n\n\nSPECSSPECIFICATION\n\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n8Hz-50kHz\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n18 Ω\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n92dB\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRD CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\n\nMICROPHONE & REMOTE\nNADESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\n\nWEIGHT\n405g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

To claim warranty read more on HiFiMAN warranty here. We are very helpful guys, just saying.\n\nWhich drivers are used in HiFiMAN Edition XS?\n\nThe HiFiMAN Edition XS is loaded with Planar magnetic drivers that delivers an excellent audiophile sound.\n\nDoes the HiFiMAN Edition XS come with detachable cables?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want to replace or upgrade cables.\n\nCan I use the HiFiMAN Edition XS for long hours?\n\nThe HiFiMAN Edition XS is made of lightweight that allows you to use them for long hours without experiencing fatigue. The soft leather headband and over-ear design with memory foam earpads also helps in the same.\n\nDoes the HiFiMAN Edition XS come with mic?\n\nNo, the HiFiMAN Edition XS does not come with a microphone.\n\nWhat do “Impedance” and “Ohms” mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Edition XS comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this  Sennheiser HD 600 comes with a 2 year warranty from Sennheiser that covers manufacturing defects.

This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n \nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\n\n\nSpecs\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversalDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω like.\n\n\nDOWNLOADS\nATH-M70x & ATH-R70x Literature \nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n3 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this  Audio-Technica ATH-R70x comes with a 3 year warranty from Audio-Technica that covers manufacturing defects.

Read more on warranty claim here.\n\nHow does the Sennheiser HD 560S sound?\n\nThe HD 560S treats your ears to audiophile sound quality. With great clarity over the mids and the highs and it’s wide soundstage takes your music listening experience to a next level.\n\nDoes the Sennheiser HD 560S come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Sennheiser HD 560S does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nCan I use the Sennheiser HD 560S for long hours?\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S is made of lightweight durable plastics that allows you to use them for long hours without experiencing fatigue. The soft leather headband and over-ear design with memory foam earpads also helps in the same.\n\nDo I require an amp to drive the Sennheiser HD 560S?\n\nYes, to bring the best of these headphones an Amp is recommended. You could have a look at our collection of portable Amps here and desktop Amps here.\n\nWhat is the impedance on the Sennheiser HD 560S?\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S comes with the impedance of 120Ω.\n\nWhat do “Impedance” and “Ohms” mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEW\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this  Sennheiser HD 560S comes with a 2 year warranty from Sennheiser that covers manufacturing defects.

The thickly padded memory earcups make a product that not only looks luxurious but also makes you feel special. 40MM NEODYMIUM MAGNETS FOR A RICH, BALANCED SOUND\n\n\nA 40mm Neodymium magnet is placed on the side of each earcup and is designed to resonate in harmony providing a nice and wide soundstage.

To combat discomfort of any kind, the manganese spring steel headband delivers even pressure for any head size.

Construction uses no glue, just nuts and bolts.

Besides the usual warranty that every brand offers, the 99 Neo's parts are endlessly serviceable. Each component can be easily substituted for another.

On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nEARMARKED AS 'THE STUDIO LEGEND'\n\n\nBeyerdynamic developed The DT series in order to deliver optimal sound in a wide variety of applications and situations. They're dynamic with their headphone designs well suited for a broad range of environments.  The DT 880 PRO are ideal for mixing, editing and mastering purposes. The unaltered neutral sound, top-notch stereo imaging, and the extremely high resolution make the Beyerdynamic DT 880 PRO studio headphones a top pick studio use. With the detailed stereo imaging, they help professionals pick up on errors immediately making them ideal for mixing and mastering.ADJUSTABLE HEADBAND, VELOUR EARPADS FOR ADDED COMFORT\n\n\nSoft earpads and adjustable, sliding, earpieces together with a single sided connecting cable ensure listening comfort during extended periods of use. Durability of the DT 880 Pro is unquestionable thanks to its spring steel headband. They are built to withstand the long hours at the studio and tantrums on the stage.\nNATURAL SOUND AND SUPERIOR SONIC EXPERIENCE\n\n\nThe semi-open back design allows the studio headphones to create natural sounding music.The diaphragm has been made extremely light for better impulse performance. An extremely strong neodymium magnet system offers the DT 8800 highly detailed sound reproduction quality, and is mechanically very robust. This increased efficiency also leaves the DT 880 with greater power reserves for succinct linear response that is especially suited for high-achieving audio applications where appropriate sonic reproduction is of utmost importance, and dedicated equipment is available such as a headphone amplifier.\n\n\n\nSEMI-OPEN, SPACIOUS AND TRANSPARENT SOUNDSTAGE\n\n\nThe DT 880's semi-open, over-the-ear design offers slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage, while retaining the high fidelity normally associated with open-back studio headphones. The semi open back also lets the studio headphones breathe which make the sound reproduced natural sounding and enhance it to a great extent.\n\n\n\nSpecs\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVERS\n45mm\n\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n250Ω\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n96 dB @ 1 kHz\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 35,000Hz\n\n\nMAX POWER INPUT\n200 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\nGold plated stereo jack plug (3.5mm) 1/4\" adapter (6.35mm)\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversalDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\n\nWEIGHT\n295g\n\n\nGRILL\nSemi-Open Back\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

The HE400 series has been winning hearts of critics and music lovers around the world. With the HE400se, HiFiMAN gives one more reason for you to fall in love with the HE400 series. The brand-new HE400se is a dynamic planar headphone with an advanced conductive layer that covers the diaphragm reducing distortion to incredibly low levels.A THIN YET POWERFUL STEALTH MAGNET FOR DISTORTION FREE SONIC BLISS\n\n\nThe specially designed Stealth magnet has a unique role to play in the HE400se. Unlike traditional magnets, a stealth magnet allows soundwaves to pass without any kind of interference. The overall magnet design of the HE400se is acoustically transparent to keep the wave diffraction turbulence in check. This decrease in distortion promotes audio accuracy and enhances the audio range which ultimately leads to pure sonic bliss.\nA POWERHOUSE PLANAR HEADPHONE FOR YOUR SMARTPHONE & TABLET\n\n\nThe planar magnetic HE400se headphone is highly sensitive making it a perfect match for audio sources with low voltage like your smartphones or your tablets. There is no need to plug in an outboard amplifier to get a pure and rich sound. The HiFiMAN HE400se is a highly proficient headphone that leaves no stone unturned to offer excellent sonic performance.ALL DAY WEARING COMFORT FOR THE PLEASURE OF MUSIC LISTENING\n\n\nMusic is best experienced with comfortable headphones.

The headband of the HE400se is lightweight and adjustable which helps you to get a comfortable fit. Rest assured these headphones are cool and comfy even during extended hours of listening.\nWITH DRIVER-PROTECTING CASING AND DURABLE CONNECTION OPTIONS\n\n\nDrivers are the core of the HiFiMAN HE400se. That's where this planar magnetic headphone finds its strength to drive rich and clear sound. In order to make sure that these drivers are well-protected, a newly designed casing is employed. This enhances the durability of the drivers while also keeping them secure.

On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 990 Pro model gives a neutral and clear sound.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro come with a mic? \n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a semi open over-the-ear headphone which gives a slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage\n\nHow is the overall fit? \n\nBeyerdynamic DT 990 Pro comes with an adjustable headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo,it does not have detachable cable.\n\nWhich devices are compatible?\n\nThe DT 990 Pro is compatible with Android and iOS devices as well as studio monitoring eqiupments.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro good for long useage?\n\nYes, due to it being durable, lightweight and soft earpads make music listening for long hours comfortable\n\nDoes it need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro? \n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 990 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of DT 990 Pro? \n\nSince most headphone output in professional environments isn't designed for 600-ohms headphones, Beyerdynamic only offers headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nHow does the Tygr 300 R differ from the DT 880 Pro and the DT 990 Pro? \n\nThe DT 880 PRO has a very linear frequency response, while the DT 990 PRO has a slightly more accentuated bass and accordingly more present trebles for a pleasant balance. Both are primarily designed for studio applications. The TYGR 300 R focuses on gaming. Powerful bass and detailed accentuated treble go very well with gaming. However, the sound design of the DT 990 PRO has been further optimized for gaming, sometimes through the use of a special acoustic fleece.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot-embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Ω, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Ω, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWhat do \"impedance\" and \"ohms\" mean? \n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω like the T 1.\n\nAre the DT 990 Pro Available with less headband pressure? \n\nNo, the professional headphones are only available with the defined headband pressure. If the headband pressure is too strong for you, you can slightly try to expand the installed spring steel in the headband. For this purpose, we recommend stretching the headphones gradually for a few hours over books or similar. You should choose the width a little bit wider than the width of your head.\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n \n 10+ of the Best Over Ear Headphones in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty  May 09, 2020 \n Over-ear headphones are one of the most popular types of headphones.

In order to claim warranty, please visit our Audio-Technica warranty page. We are very helpful guys, just saying.\n\nThe sound signature of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is?\n\nVery flat. Essentially made for professional studio monitoring, you can expect a neutral sound from the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Bassheads, leave now before you set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nIs the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x ideal for DJs?\n\nNo, they are not. You can have a look at the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 as it is ideal for DJ and live shows.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with an open-back design?\n\nNo, it doesn’t. If you are looking for a wide soundstage our top recommendation will be the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro. It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the ATH-M50x.\n\nWill Audio-Technica ATH-M50x require an Amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x and the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro?\n\nThe Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro will have a flatter response, as accurate to the source as possible. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x will have relatively extended low end in comparison.\n\nDoes detachable cable mean I can use it without the wire as well?\n\nNo, they can’t. Detachable cables mean they can be replaced when they go south!\n\nAre Audio-Technica ATH-M50x built to last? Could I use it when travelling?\n\nYes, they are durable and are travel friendly since they fold and a travel carry pouch is also included with the product.\n\nCould I change the parts if they wear out?\n\nYes, we provide high quality replacement parts for the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. You can replace the headband and the earpads from Headphone Zone directly.\n\nHow many cables does the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with?\n\nThe product comes with 3 cables: 3.9 to 9.8' (1.2 to 3 m) Coiled Cable, 9.8' (3 m) Straight Cable and 3.9' (1.2 m) Straight Cable. Who doesn't like options?\n\nWhat devices is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x compatible with?\n\nThese headphones are mostly used by studio professionals and come with a 6.3mm adaptor for use with consoles. You can also use the 3.5mm jack with your laptop or smartphone.\n\nIs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x an ideal product for everyday casual use?\n\nIdeally no. Because these require a dedicated amp for the best quality and because they're quite flat sounding, we wouldn't recommend these to casual music listeners.\n\nHow do Audio-Technica ATH-M50x stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nBoth these headphones are flagship products under the 10k range having their strenghts and usability. To help understand better we have an easy to understand blog comparing the Audio Technica M50x vs Ultrasone Performance 820 here.\n\n\nBUYING GUIDE\n\n \nBest Headphones under 10000 in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty February 27, 2020\nScan through the list with our go-to guide of headphones under Rs. 10000 to find the best one for you.\nRead More\n\n\n \nBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro vs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x\nby Abhijeeth Shetty March 04, 2020\nComparing the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro and Audio Technica ATH M50X.

You can have a look at the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 as it is ideal for DJ and live shows.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro open-back?\n\nNo, it does not come with open-back design. If you are looking for a wide soundstage our top recommendation will be the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro. It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the DT 770 PRO.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro come with a mic? \n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a closed-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music even better thanks to its natural noise isolation.\n\nHow is the overall fit? \n\nBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro fits on the ear so don't go expecting the earcups to envelop your ears in lush comfort.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo, Unfortunately it does not come with a detachable cable feature.\n\nDo you need an Amplifier for 80 Ohms or 250 Ohms?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nHow do these stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nApart from both these headphones being able to be driven easily by your smartphones it is also a choice between a warm and smooth sound against a balanced sound. Read more comparison between the two headphones here\n\nWill the DT 1770 Pro replace the DT 770 Pro?\n\nNo, the DT 1770 Pro is an upgraded version of the DT 770 PRO, made for audio engineers, producers, and musicians who need a pair of high-end studio headphones without compromising on performance in all the aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories. The DT 770 Pro is for beginners who want a reliable, robust, and affordable pair of headphones to work with.\n\nWhat is the difference between Pro and edition models of DT 770, DT 880, and DT 990? \n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my DT 770 Pro? \n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 770 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of the DT 770 Pro models? \n\nIn professional environments most headphone outputs aren't designed for 600-ohms headphones, we only offer headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhy does my DT 770/990 Pro have another connection cable with a smaller thread? \n\nIn order to be able to plug the headphones with the 3.5 mm jack (unscrewed jack adapter) into a mobile device with a bumper, the M8 thread, which was previously available, was converted to a smaller M5 thread. If your headphones have such an M5 thread you will need an adapter. If you own an M8 threaded jack adapter you can still use it for your headphones, but only as a plug adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro? \n\nThe DT 770/990 Pro is made for beginners musicians, sound engineers, producers who are looking for a reliable, sturdy, and affordable pair of headphones as a working device.

In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\nDoes the Shure - SRH240A need and amp?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedence which cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound.\n\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this  Shure SRH240A comes with a 2 year warranty from Shure that covers manufacturing defects.

PROFESSIONAL. PERFORMANCE.\n\n\nThe M-Series ATH-M40x professional monitor headphones are tuned flat for incredibly accurate audio monitoring across an extended frequency range. Now enhance your studio experience with superior sound isolation and swiveling earcups for convenient one-ear monitoring.\n40MM DRIVERS WITH RARE EARTH MAGNETS AND COPPER-CLAD ALUMINIUM WIRE VOICE COILS\n\n\nThe drivers used in the ATH-M40x are 40mm large and custom made drivers with copper-coated aluminum voice coils and rare-earth magnets. They're fine tuned to deliver a superior sonic experience!\n\n\n\nHITS THAT SWEET SPOT FOR BASS\n\n\nThe M40x is tuned flat for incredibly accurate sound monitoring across the entire frequency range spectrum to produce stupendously clear, clean and most of all, balanced. You can distinctly hear bright sounding vocals and instrumentals in a single track - which creates a large sense of scale that’s obviously the exact opposite of cluttered and muddy-sounding audio. CUTTING-EDGE ENGINEERING AND ROBUST CONSTRUCTION\n\n\n The M40x, even though made of plastic, is known for its use of high quality textured matte construction and overall solid durability. The Pro grade material has been used for the ear cups as well as the headband.\n\n\n\n90° SWIVELING CLOSED-BACK EARCUPS FOR ONE-EAR MONITORING\n\n\n The cups literally contour your ears and place them inside an air-tight enclosure that feels plush and comfortable. There is no pressure being placed against your ears as a roomy interior is provided. Circumaural design contours around the ears for excellent sound isolation in loud environments.\nSTRAIGHT AND COILED SINGLE SIDED CABLE OPTIONS\n\n\n The M40x includes two cable options: 1.2 m - 3.0 m coiled cable and 3.0 m straight cable. The 3m straight single-side cable is designed to make the headphones convenient for studio tracking, mixing and field recording. They are very convenient in terms of usage and make life simple.\n\n\nSPECSAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm Drivers\n\n\nIMPEDANCE\n35 Ohms\n\n\nSENSITIVITY\n98dB\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 24,000Hz\n\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\n\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\n\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\n\nCABLE TYPE\n1.2-3m Coiled Cable, 3m DJ Cable\n\n\nWEIGHT\n240g\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

It has a better signal to noise ratio and a much lower power consumption than the original DragonFly. It consists of Gordon's monoClock® (single ultra-low-jitter clock). Thanks to the new Microchip PIC32MX274 microcontroller, the processing speed increases by 33%. This makes it perfect to play music at all kinds of resolution (including MQA) and from any music streaming app of your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESS ES9038Q2M DAC CHIP & 9601 AMP FOR POWERFUL SOUND WITH LESSER NOISE\n\n\nThe DragonFly Cobalt has an output of 2.1 volts—enough power to successfully drive all preamplifier input circuits and a wide range of today’s efficient headphones. Its improved power supply filtering specifically reduces the noise of WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular signals. It comes with a 32-bit ESS ES9038Q2M DAC chip that employs minimum-phase slow roll-off filtering for naturally detailed, more authentic sound. The ESS Sabre 9601 headphone amp and bit-perfect digital volume control add that much-needed power. You can use the source device's volume controls to adjust the DragonFly Cobalt's volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORKS BEST WITH ANY DEVICE OF YOUR CHOICE\n\n\nThe DragonFly Cobalt's software can be easily upgraded thanks to the Desktop Device Manager. It includes a form-fitting DragonTail USB-A to USB-C Adaptor. All DragonTails use AQ's Carbon-level USB cable. Streamlength™ asynchronous USB code ensures low jitter, low resource load, minimal packet errors, world-class audio playback, and reliable connectivity between the DAC and any computing device with a USB input. It requires no additional drivers, making the DragonFly Cobalt virtually plug-and-play for Apple, Windows, iOS and Android users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTS MQA FOR MASTER-QUALITY SOUND\n\n\nThe Dragonfly Cobalt supports Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) playback. This is an award-winning audio technology that's meant to deliver the sound of the original master recording. MQA files are tiny and can easily be streamed using Tidal. \n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nSTATUS/SAMPLE RATES SUPPORTED (LED INDICATOR COLOR CODE)\nStandby (Red), 44.1kHz (Green), 48kHz (Blue), 88.2kHz (Yellow), 96kHz (Light Blue), MQA (Purple)\n\n\nVOLUME CONTROL\n64-position, 64-bit, bit-perfect\n\n\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n2.1\n\n\nHEADPHONE AMP\nESS Sabre 9601\n\n\nDAC CHIP\nESS ES9038Q2M with minimum-phase slow roll-off filter for more natural sound\n\n\nMICROCONTROLLER\nMicrochip PIC32MX274 reduces current draw and increases processing speed by 33% over DragonFlys Black and Red\n\n\nDIMENSIONS\n12mm H x 19mm W by 57mm L\n\n\nSUPPORTED INPUTS\n3.5mm Stereo Jack\n\n\nWEIGHT\n22g\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better? \n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly? \n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly? \n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer? \n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\n iOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro \nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer? \n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app: \nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device? \n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems? \n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7? \n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT? \n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following: \nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly? \n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose? \n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate? \n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate. \n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend? \n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device? \n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use? \n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device!  While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly? \n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\n\nDOWNLOADS\nFlight Manual DragonFly Cobalt\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this AudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt comes with a 1 year warranty from AudioQuest that covers manufacturing defects.

We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better? \n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly? \n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly? \n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer? \n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\n iOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro \nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer? \n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app: \nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device? \n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems? \n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7? \n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT? \n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following: \nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices? \n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly? \n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose? \n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate? \n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate. \n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend? \n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device? \n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use? \n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device!  While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly? \n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n \n Best Amp/DACs for your Headphones for Beginner Audiophiles\nby Shanth Swaroop  May 09, 2020 \n There are many kinds of DACs available at different price points.

Everyone wants one. But most are incredibly expensive, and need a big fat setup. The Cayin RU6 is set to change that. Pocket-sized, on the go, R2R goodness for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru \n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nINNOVATIVE 24BIT DISCREET R-2R RESISTOR LADDER DAC CIRCUIT\n\n\nThe Cayin RU6 features a self-developed 24bit discrete R-2R resistor ladder circuit that can decode up to 384kHz PCM audio. The basic idea of the R-2R ladder is a matched pair of resistors, the first is “R” and the other is “2R'' which has twice the value of R. To achieve 24 bit decoding, RU6 equips 48 units of resistors (23 x R and 25 x 2R), and that’s for one channel. So for a stereo 24 Bit R-2R decoder, RU6 features 96 units of resistors for life-like audio reproduction. With the advent of the R-2R circuit, Cayin RU6 establishes itself as master of the fully-discrete resistor DAC topology in portable audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFERING OVERSAMPLING AND NON-OVERSAMPLING DA MODES\n\n\nCayin offers both Oversampling and Non-oversampling DA modes in RU6. For Oversampling mode, the Digital Audio Bridge will upsample the digital audio data to 384kHz through digital filters. This will enhance the resolution, reduce noise and improve the anti-aliasing of the digital signal. The Oversampling DA mode will offer a noticeable improvement on details and frequency extension. The playback is clean and sharp with a darker background. On the other hand, NOS DA mode maintains the sampling rate of the original bit-stream and playback will become very musical with a natural and organic presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIPPED WITH FULLY ANALOGUE RESISTOR ARRAY VOLUME CONTROL\n\n\nMost USB DAC/Amps will rely on the volume control of your mobile phone to control the volume of the headphone output. Technically this was not a viable solution to Cayin RU6. Understanding this issue, Cayin developed a fully analogue resistor array volume control circuit that provides 99 steps volume control through 9 segments of resistors and switching relays. Resistor Array volume control features a very high-quality volume control design, extremely transparent when implemented correctly and it is found in a lot of high-end preamps and integrated amplifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEATURING DUAL CIRCUIT BOARD LAYOUT FOR DSD AND PCM PLAYBACK\n\n\nTo minimise audio signal interference, Cayin has split the RU6's circuit into two 6-layers PCB, with digital and analogue circuits installed on separate boards. This safeguards the audio signal integrity and ensures the noise from the reference clock and DSP do not bleed into the amplification circuit. This architecture in turn delivers artefact free audio every single time. This circuit design combined with the R-2R architecture enables the RU6 to support hi-resolution PCM and DSD audio formats with support for 384kHZ PCM and DSD 64/128/256 natively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTUITIVE AND VERSATILE OPERATION WITH LOW POWER CONSUMPTION\n\n\nDiscreet R-2R circuitry is a low power DAC circuit when compared to other highly integrated DAC chipsets. This architecture minimises power drain from the mobile source allowing you to enjoy music without the need to worry about battery drain. USB-C connection offers compatibility with a wide range of phones, consumer electronics and computers. The hardware has been designed in an intuitive manner, where the volume buttons double as menu selectors and the OLED screen displays playback information accurately. The Cayin RU6 also offers two gain settings to enhance performance with various IEMs and headphones. All this is wrapped in a 28g package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT INFORMATION \n\n\n\nDAC\n24bit Discrete R-2R\n\n\nHEADPHONE\n3.5mm + 4.4mm Balanced\n\n\nUSB\nType C USB Audio Input\n\n\nDISPLAY\n0.96 inch 128x64 OLED\n\n\nDIGITAL DECODING\nPCM: 44.1kHz ~ 384kHzDSD: DSD64/128/256\n\n\nCONTROL\nVolume +/-, Mode\n\n\nDIMENSION\n65mm x 25.4mm x 13.7mm\n\n\nCHASSIS\nCNC Aluminum\n\n\nNET WEIGHT\n~28g\n\n\n\n\n\nRU6 HEADPHONE OUTPUT (OS MODE)- 3.5MM\n\n\n\nPOWER RATING\n138mW @ 32Ω\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20kHz (±0.5dB)\n\n\nTHD+N\n0.032% (1kHz, Output: 0.5V)\n\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE\n109dB (20Hz-20kHz, A-Weighted)\n\n\nSNR\n113dB (20HZ-20kHz, A-Weighted)\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n0.5Ω\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRU6 HEADPHONE OUTPUT (OS MODE)- 4.4MM\n\n\n\nPOWER RATING\n213mW @ 32Ω\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20kHz (±0.5dB)\n\n\nTHD+N\n0.04% (1kHz, Output: 1V)\n\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE\n110dB (20Hz-20kHz, A-Weighted)\n\n\nSNR\n114dB (20HZ-20kHz, A-Weighted)\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n1.0Ω\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Topping has developed an NFCA module specifically for portable amplifiers like the NX7. The NFCA (Nested Feedback Composite Amplifier) module achieves clean and high power with low output impedance. The low idle power consumption allows for extended battery life. The NX7 delivers a value of 0.00007% for THD + N and 135 dB for SNR, making it one of the cleanest portable amplifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMPLE POWER TO DRIVE HEADPHONES AND IEMS WITH 3-STEP GAIN SETTINGS\n\n\nTopping NX7 has been engineered with careful consideration to drive full-sized headphones and even sensitive IEMs with ease. This is possible with the 3-step gain settings embedded in the NX7. With the help of its 3-step gain setting, NX7 can easily power full-sized headphones. The NX7 can output 180mW of high power under a load of 300Ω. Using the low gain of the NX7, you can drive IEMs. At -13.8dB, the low gain option gives you plenty of room to control the volume of extremely sensitive IEMs without damaging them or your hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERTLY BUILT WITH AN ANTI-MISTOUCH DESIGN TO PREVENT DAMAGE ON THE NX7\n\n\nThe team of designers at Topping have gone to all lengths to ensure that users of NX7 have the most enjoyable and worry-free operation when using the device. This ideology is reflected in the final design and offers a thoughtful solution to common issues. The Topping NX7 is designed with corner guards at both ends to protect the entire panel, effectively preventing the volume knob from being accidentally touched in the pocket and reducing the possibility of breaking the headphone plug. This design is considered and resolves issues with portable devices so you can enjoy music without worry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFERS 20 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE, LOW OUTPUT IMPEDANCE AND DUAL OUTPUTS\n\n\nEven though the Topping NX7 is a slim and portable device, it packs a punch in battery life. The NX7 is optimised to offer a long battery life. It can be battery-powered for 20 hours at a medium gain and can reach 10 hours at high gain. Along with this, the output impedance is 0.1Ω. As a result, even high-sensitivity IEMs do not cause timbre colouring. With Topping NX7, you can use it without hiss noise without having to think about sound matching. The NX7 also offers dual headphone outputs with 3.5mm and 4.4mm connections to plug your headphones or IEMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUNDLED WITH A VARIETY OF ACCESSORIES TO HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH NX7\n\n\nTopping NX7 comes bundled with an array of accessories to help you get started with the NX7. You get a USB charging cable and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable for quick connectivity and charging the NX7. You also get a rubber pad and rubber band to place your NX7 and avoid damaging the device. Along with these, you get a user manual and a warranty card to get you started. The inclusion of these accessories is thoughtful and allows you to get started with NX7 right out of the box.\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\n3.5MM HEADPHONE OUTPUT\n\n\n\nTHD+N @1kHz (A-wt)\n<0.00008% @ 200mW 32Ω <0.00007% @83mW 300Ω\n\n\nTHD @20-20kHz (90kBW)\n<0.0010% @ 200mW 32Ω <0.0002% @ 83mW 300Ω\n\n\nSNR @ MAX OUT 1kHz (A-wt)\n135dB\n\n\nSNR @ 50mV OUT 1kHz\n 104dB\n\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE @1kHz (A-wt)\n135dB\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz - 40kHz (±0.1dB)\n\n\nOUTPUT LEVEL\n7.4Vpp @G=L 11Vpp @G=M 21Vpp @G=H\n\n\nAP MEASURE NOISE LEVEL@A-wt\n<0.7uVrms @G=L <0.7uVrms @G=M <2.0uVrms @G=H\n\n\nAP MEASURE NOISE LEVEL@A-wt\n<0.3uVrms @G=L <0.3uVrms @G=M <1.3uVrms @G=H\n\n\nCHANNEL CROSSTALK@1kHz\n-91dB\n\n\nINPUT SENSITIVITY\n13Vrms @G=L 4Vrms @G=M 1.5Vrms @G=H\n\n\nGAIN\n-13.8dB @G=L -0.1dB @G=M 13.9dB @G=H\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n<0.1Ω\n\n\nOUTPUT POWER\n1200mW x2 @16Ω THD+N<0.1% 1400mW x2 @32Ω THD+N<0.1% 820mW x2 @64Ω THD+N<0.1% 180mW x2 @300Ω THD+N<0.1% 90mW x2 @600Ω THD+N<0.1%\n\n\nADAPTER IMPEDANCE\n>8Ω\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4MM HEADPHONE OUTPUT \n\n\n\nTHD+N @1kHz (A-wt)\n<0.00008% @ 200mW 32Ω <0.00007% @83mW 300Ω\n\n\nTHD @20-20kHz (90kBW)\n<0.0010% @ 200mW 32Ω <0.0002% @ 83mW 300Ω\n\n\nSNR @ MAX OUT 1kHz (A-wt)\n135dB\n\n\nSNR @ 50mV OUT 1kHz\n 104dB\n\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE @1kHz (A-wt)\n135dB\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz - 40kHz (±0.1dB)\n\n\nOUTPUT LEVEL\n7.4Vpp @G=L 11Vpp @G=M 21Vpp @G=H\n\n\nAP MEASURE NOISE LEVEL@A-wt\n<0.7uVrms @G=L <0.7uVrms @G=M <2.0uVrms @G=H\n\n\nAP MEASURE NOISE LEVEL@A-wt\n<0.3uVrms @G=L <0.3uVrms @G=M <1.3uVrms @G=H\n\n\nCHANNEL CROSSTALK@1kHz\n-96dB\n\n\nINPUT SENSITIVITY\n13Vrms @G=L 4Vrms @G=M 1.5Vrms @G=H\n\n\nGAIN\n-13.8dB @G=L -0.1dB @G=M 13.9dB @G=H\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n<0.1Ω\n\n\nOUTPUT POWER\n1200mW x2 @16Ω THD+N<0.1% 1400mW x2 @32Ω THD+N<0.1% 820mW x2 @64Ω THD+N<0.1% 180mW x2 @300Ω THD+N<0.1% 90mW x2 @600Ω THD+N<0.1%\n\n\nADAPTER IMPEDANCE\n>8Ω\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

These are simple and cost-effective, but they cannot compare with expertly designed, individually optimised circuit stages when it comes to sound quality. The iFi Audio GO Blu showcases a clever design that packs in separate Bluetooth + DAC + Amp stages, each engineered in distinct blocks to deliver the ideal combination of cutting-edge specification and superb sound. The GO Blue utilises the latest Cirrus Logic CS43131 chip for all audio conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMBEDDED WITH QUALCOMM BLUETOOTH CHIP AND DIRECT DRIVE AMP CIRCUIT\n\n\nThe Bluetooth stage in the iFi Audio GO Blu makes use of Qualcomm’s latest four-core QCC5100 Bluetooth chip. This chip feeds the DAC stage with a Cirrus Logic 32-bit DAC chip at its heart and is coupled with a customized digital filter to minimize pre-echoes and ringing artefacts. A precision clock system is embedded to ensure ultra-low jitter, reducing errors and distortion in the digital audio signal. The Amplifier circuitry benefits from symmetrical twin-mono signal paths and utilizes iFi’s Direct Drive design to ensure a clean signal path without distortion-inducing output coupling capacitors. The amplifier stage delivers up to 5.6V, handling tough headphone loads with ease. To ensure signal strength is suitable for sensitive headphones and earphones, auto-gain adjusts output up or down by 6dB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFERS BLUETOOTH 5.1 CONNECTIVITY WITH SUPPORT FOR HI-RES FORMATS\n\n\niFi Audio GO Blu utilises Qualcomm’s latest four-core QCC5100 chip with support for Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. Bluetooth 5.1 technology ensures the best possible range, stability and performance. The latest four-core QCC5100 processing chip offers support for every high-definition Bluetooth audio format, including aptX Adaptive and aptX HD, LDAC and HWA/LHDC. Other codecs covered include regular aptX and aptX Low Latency, AAC and SBC. You can also use the USB-C connection and enjoy High-Res USB audio too, with PCM audio up to 24-bit/96kHz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCUSTOMISED SONIC TAILORING OPTIONS WITH XBASS AND XSPACE FEATURES\n\n\nThe iFi Audio GO Blu offers sonic tailoring options with two user-selectable features - XBass and XSpace. The first is XBass, a sophisticated form of ‘bass boost’ that enhances low frequencies without muddying the midrange, particularly useful with earphones and open-back headphones that may lack deep bass. The second is XSpace, a setting designed to compensate for the ‘in-head localisation’ effect that can occur when using headphones to listen to music that was mixed using a pair of speakers, effectively widening the headphone soundstage to deliver a more spacious and speaker-like experience. Both these settings operate entirely in the analogue domain rather than messing with the digital signal via DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and may be switched in or out of the signal path.\n\n\n\n\n\nDUAL OUTPUTS WITH PENTACONN CONNECTOR AND S BALANCED CIRCUITRY\n\n\nThe iFi Audio GO Blu is designed to offer easy connectivity with dual headphone connectors. Whether you use balanced or unbalanced headphones, you get the low noise and best channel separation for the most enjoyable experience. The GO Blu boasts a Pentaconn 4.4mm output enabling headphones equipped with balanced connectivity to take full advantage of the GO Blu’s balanced amp design. In addition, the 3.5mm output benefits from iFi’s proprietary S-Balanced circuitry. This cuts crosstalk and related distortion in half when used with regular, single-ended headphone connections, this is especially beneficial with high-sensitivity in-ear monitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPORTABLE LIGHTWEIGHT BUILD WITH SWISS CHRONOGRAPH DESIGN\n\n\niFi Audio GO Blu weighs only 26g and with its lightweight, soft-touch polymer enclosure, copper-coloured trim and ChronoDial watch crown-style control. iFi Audio has even incorporated a high-quality chip-based (CMOS-MEMS) microphone, enabling hands-free calls, voice chat for gaming and access to voice assistants such as Apple Siri and Google Assistant. The ChronoDial on the GO Blu is a masterpiece of precision engineering, just like a chronograph watch. The ChronoDial offers precise, analogue volume control and you can also use it to play, pause and skip tracks forward and backwards. You can even activate the voice assistant on your Bluetooth connected smart devices.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nCHIPSET\nDAC: Cirrus Logic CS43131 Bluetooth: Qualcomm QCC 5100\n\n\nINPUTS\nWireless: Bluetooth 5.1 ( AAC, SBC, aptX, aptX HD, aptX Adaptive, aptX LL, LDAC, LHDC/HWA Codec  Wired: USB-C (24/96)\n\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\n\nHEADPHONE OUTPUTS\nBalanced: 4.4mmSE: 3.5mm\n\n\nPOWER OUTPUT\nBalanced: 245mW @ 32Ω; 5.6v @ 600ΩSE: 165mW @ 32Ω; 2.8v @ 600Ω\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\nBalanced: <1Ω SE: <1Ω\n\n\nSNR\nBalanced: 111dB(A) @ 0dBFS SE: 116.5dB(A) @ 0dBFS\n\n\nDNR\nBalanced/SE: >120dB(A)\n\n\nTHD+N\nBalanced: <0.009% @ (6.5mW/2.0v@600Ω) SE: <0.03% @ (100mW/1.27v@16Ω)\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz - 45kHz (-3dB)\n\n\nBATTERY TYPE\nLithium-polymer\n\n\nBATTERY CAPACITY\n450mAh\n\n\nBATTERY LIFE\nApproximately 8 hours (depending upon volume and headphones)\n\n\nPOWER SYSTEM\nCharging via USB-C, BC V1.2 compliant up to 1000mA charging current and 6.3 volts\n\n\nSIZE\n54 x 34 x 13mm 2.1' x 1.3' x 0.5'\n\n\nWEIGHT\n27g (0.95 oz)\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. iFi Audio GO blu\n\n\n\n2.

To claim warranty click here.\n\nWhich DAC chip does the iFi Audio GO blu come with? \n\nThe iFi Audio GO blu is loaded with Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC Chip that offers a great audiophile-grade sound quality.\n\nCan you charge the GO blu and listen at the same time? \n\nYes. The battery will charge to 80%. While power is being drawn from the battery with the GO blu switched on, its voltage lowers, and the charging circuit takes this into account. Turning off the GO blu allows the battery to charge fully.\n\nHow long does it take for a full battery charge? \n\nApprox 40 minutes with a high-powered charger.\n\nHow many listening hours would there be after a full charge?\n\nThat depends on a few things; how loud you play it and the type of music (heavy bass and inefficient headphones use more power), distance away from the connected device, temperature to name a few. But, generally you can listen up to 10 hours or more.\n\nDoes the iFi Audio GO blu support balanced output? \n\nYes, the iFi Audio GO blu comes with a 3.5mm and 4.4mm Balanced output.\n\nCan you use the 4.4mm and 3.5mm outputs at the same time?\n\nYes. The 3.5mm output and the positive phase on the 4.4mm output are wired together.\n\nCan you use Apple Music Lossless via Bluetooth? \n\nIn order to transmit Hi-Res via Bluetooth up to 96kHz (limited by the Bluetooth standard) you need to use a Hi-Res Bluetooth transmitter connected via USB to your device, then connect Bluetooth to the Hi-Res transmitter. Alternatively you can connect the GO blu directly to your device with a USB-to-Lightning cable for up to 96kHz capability.\n\nDoes listening to the GO blu on USB switch off the Bluetooth connection?\n\nIf a Bluetooth connection has been established first the connected device will use it preferentially. The USB connection can be selected as an alternative. If you have two devices connected, one with Bluetooth and the other with USB, you can select between them on your two devices by playing one or the other.\n\nDoes the GO blu go into sleep mode? \n\nIn pairing mode, shown by the top LED flashing blue and red, the GO blu is searching for a device to pair with. It will go to sleep if one isn’t found after 5 minutes. If a Bluetooth device is connected the GO blu will stay on until its battery is flat, or the connected device goes into sleep mode or is turned off. The GO blu then enters pairing mode if another Bluetooth device isn’t found and goes to sleep after 5 minutes as above.\n\nWhat is voice assistant? \n\nWhen you long-press the button on the multi-function knob, your device’s voice assistant will wake up (if enabled). Eg. Siri on Apple or Google Assistant on Android. The microphone on the GO blu is located next to the charging LED on the bottom. No need to speak right into the microphone, it’s quite sensitive.\n\n\nDOWNLOADS\nUser Manual\nTech Notes\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this iFi Audio GO blu comes with a 1 year warranty from iFi Audio that covers manufacturing defects.

They feature both a 2.5mm and 4.4mm balanced output, which means no matter what headphone, its a simple plug and play. They have both iOS and Android cables included, and they are powerful enough to drive even full-sized headphones. Absolutely Flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru \n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nLISTEN TO MUSIC IN PURE, NATURAL SOUND WITH THE THX AAA AMPLIFIER TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nTHX is known for its patented feed-forward error correction AAA amps. One such AAA amp is used in the FiiO Q3 to reduce distortion, use clean power to offer a pure and uncoloured sound. The use of dual crystal oscillators, independent LPF circuit and low noise volume adjustment adds more efficiency to music listening. This will highlight even subtle nuances of your favourite songs which you would have otherwise failed to recognise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWERED BY AK4462 DAC AND XMOS XUF208 USB CHIP FOR A INTERFERENCE-FREE, CLEAN HI-FI MUSIC LISTENING\n\n\nAdopting a brand-new and super-efficient AK4462 VELVET SOUND DAC from AKM along with a flagship XMOS XUF208 USB chip, the FiiO Q3 has the ability to decode up to 768kHz/32-bit PCM and DSD512. This allows the Q3 to deliver a high-quality music listening experience. The combination of an all-aluminium body, copper-nickel shield and highly efficient absorbers creates a full-fledged 360° radio frequency interference shield around the Q3 for an interference-free sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIC ROUND-SHAPED DESIGN ALONG WITH AN RGB INDICATOR THAT DISPLAYS SAMPLING RATE\n\n\nAdhering to the designing language of other FiiO amplifiers, the Q3 sports stylish curves, simple lines and a smooth CNC and sandblasted aluminium body. This elaborate design not only adds appeal to the design but also makes it durable for practical use. There is an RGB indicator on the analogue potentiometer volume knob that keeps you aware of the sampling rate while the knob itself lets you adjust the volume with precision.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRANGE OF BALANCED/ UNBALANCED CONNECTORS FOR BETTER CONNECTIVITY\n\n\nThere is a range of connectivity options that you get with the FiiO Q3 including the 4.4mm/2.5mm balanced outputs and a standard 3.5mm single-ended output. This lets you connect almost all kinds of headphones to your FiiO Q3. Kindly note that the 4.4mm/2.5mm are prioritized over the SE 3.5mm. The Q3 also has the symmetrical Type-C connector which can be used to be connected to other devices. It also supports USB PD and lightning charging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATED BASS BOOST FUNCTION FOR BASSHEADS & A MULTI-FUNCTION BUTTON FOR GAIN ADJUSTMENT\n\n\nThere is a dedicated bass switch for the bass boost function that instantly gives you control over the intensity of the bass output. This works because of a purely hardware-based bass amplifier circuit that can increase bass up to 6dB without interfering with the mids or treble. You also get a versatile multi-function button that you can use to switch between gain levels. Press the button for a short time to switch between low and high gain while a double tap on the button will let you cycle between sharp and slow roll-off filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA POWERFUL BATTERY LIFE OF UP TO 10 HOURS TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY\n\n\nPowerful components need a powerful battery to be driven and therefore the FiiO Q3 comes with a 1800mAH long-lasting battery. It gives an overall battery life of up to 10 hours or more under USB decoding. This is enough battery to get you through the day on a normal day of listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\nMAIN UNIT\n\n\n\nMODEL\nQ3\n\n\nCOLOR\nBlack\n\n\nDIMENSIONS\n105mmx59mmx12.5mm\n\n\nWEIGHT\nAbout 110g (incl. battery)\n\n\nTEST HEADPHONES\nPO+M3 earbuds (27Ω)BAL+32Ω earbuds\n\n\nTEST VOLUME\n40mV output\n\n\nCHARGING TIME\n≤2h\n\n\nBATTERY CAPACITY\n1800mAh\n\n\nBATTERY LIFE\nUSB In - PO: 10HBAL: 8.5H AUX In - BAL: 19H\n\n\nAUDIO INPUT\nType C USB/3.5mm port\n\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nDC 5V 2A recommended\n\n\nNATIVE DSD SUPPORTED\nDSD64/128/256/512\n\n\nMAX.

You can simply get in touch with us to claim the warranty.Click here.\n\nSignal input and output way\n\n【Supported input mode; Output priority】 1. UAC mode (USB DAC): USB input, 2.5/3.5/4.4 output: It supports PO and BAL output, among which BAL is prior. (When PO and BAL port are inserted at the same time, PO has no output and BAL has output). When 2 BAL or all the 3 ports (PO and 2 BAL) are inserted, there will be no sound. 2. AUX mode (pure headphone amplifier): 3.5 LO input, 2.5/4.4 BAL output: Only supports BAL2.5 or BAL4.4 output. If both BAL ports are inserted, there will be no sound. 【Priority of USB DAC and AUX mode: USB DAC prior】 1. Once the Q3 is connected to a USB device that is playing normally, the USB DAC mode will be prior. 2. When the Q3 is not connected to a USB device or it is connected but not playing music, it will work in Aux mode if both AUX and BAL are inserted. When in AUX mode, the Q3 is connected to a USB device and the music begins, it will auto-switch to USB DAC mode. When the music stops for more than 5 seconds, it will auto-switch to AUX mode. 3. USB DAC stops playback includes: Stop playback, pause playback, play silent tracks, minimize the volume on the app.\n\nWhen connected to a computer for decoding, is it possible that neither did the power of the Q3 not be consumed, nor did it not charge the Q3, instead the power consumption is completely provided by the computer?\n\nImpossible. When the Charge switch is ON, the computer would be prior to charging the Q3. At the same time, the Q3 will also charge its battery. When the Charge switch is OFF, the Q3 is completely powered by its own battery, so the battery power will be consumed.\n\nWhen the Q3 works as a USB DAC for the player, the player does not support DSD512 in DOP output mode? \n\nIt is limited by the player itself. The DOP output mode only supports DSD256 at most. Whereas DSD512 will only be enabled under Native output mode.\n\nWhat are the Charging, battery life and indicator light instruction on the FiiO Q3?\n\nCharging, battery life and indicator light instruction It is recommended to use 5V/2A adapters to charge the Q3. Adapters, computers, laptops and other devices that can normally output 5V voltage can be used to charge it. Note: Quick-charging is not available for the Q3.\n\nHighest decoding rate supported? \n\nPCM supports up to 768k/32bit DSD supports up to native DSD512.\n\n\nDOWNLOADS\nQ3 User Manual\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this FiiO Q3 comes with a 1 year warranty from FiiO that covers manufacturing defects.

It comes with Super Low ESR tantal capacitors and 4-layered gold-plated PCB technology that reduces the noise to nothing while preserving the sound quality. This will help you experience even the minutest detail of your music particularly with hi-res audio files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTS TIDAL MASTERS (MQA) & QOBUZ HIGH-RES PLAYBACK\n\n\nThe Sparrow is integrated with an MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) renderer which promotes optimum MQA playback. It also supports encoding which folds additional data into the signal which can be recovered later. You can access Tidal Masters (MQA) through a smartphone. It even supports Qobuz’s high-res playback on smartphones, Windows, and Mac OS. Qobuz allows users to stream and download songs in one of the most popular formats for mastering and archiving — FLAC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTURN YOUR SMARTPHONE INTO A PRO AUDIO DEVICE\n\n\nIf you use your smartphone as the source device for music, the EarMen Sparrow is ideal for you. It sports a lightweight design along with a durable CNC milling aluminum enclosure which prevents any kind of interference to seep into the audio signal. The curved smooth edges make it seem as though they are a part of the cable without getting entangled. You don't have to install the driver manually because it comes with an in-built adaptive driver. The connection can be utilized directly and it conveniently transforms smartphones into professional audio equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nINPUT\nUSB-C Female\n\n\nOUTPUT\n2.5mm Balanced 3.5mm\n\n\nOUTPUT POWER\nBalance 2.0Vrms / Unbalance 1.4Vrms into 32 Ohm Balance 4.0Vrms / Unbalance 2.0Vrms into 600 Ohm\n\n\nTHD+N\n-112dB, 2.0Vrms into 600 Ohm -110dB, 1.0Vrms into 32 Ohm\n\n\nAUDIO FORMAT\nDSD 64/128 DoP, DXD 384/352.5 kHzPCM Up to 384 kHz, MQA Rendering Up to 384 kHz\n\n\nDIMENSION\n42 x 8 x 22\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nUPGRADED WITH AN HIGH QUALITY ADVANCED DAC CHIP AND USB TYPE-C CONNECTIVITY\n\n\nOne of the notable developments in the FiiO E10K-TC is its PCM5102 DAC chip. This chip brings about significant improvements in the functionality of the E10K-TC and improved audio quality without any phase shift or delays. The PCM5102 DAC can handle PCM files up to 32-bit/384kHz, or outputting 192 kHz over coaxial S/PDIF while improving audio quality via a linear internal filter; this also reduces delay, improves internal silence on changing tracks and induces no phase shifts. Now you can connect the E10K-TC to your laptop via its USB Type-C connection, which also provides it with power and offers a better interface with modern devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEATURING AN UPDATED AMPLIFICATION STAGE, BASS BOOST CIRCUIT AND XMOS CHIP\n\n\nFiiO E10K-TC now comes embedded with an LMH6643 OP-Amp that elevates its driving power exponentially. The FiiO E10K-TC offers an output power of 200mW @32Ω and a USB decoding sample rate of 24 bit / 96kHz with enhanced transient response. Keeping up with the times, the E10K-TC comes embedded with the flagship XMOS XUF208 chip for more efficient USB decoding. This offers USB Audio Class 2.0 and supports up to 32bit/384kHz playback. The E10K-TC is also equipped with a Dual Gain setting that has an optimised low-pass filter along with a selectable Bass Boost circuit that delivers a low noise floor. Taking control of the volume is easy with the volume control knob that offers precise increments or decrements in volume and you can enable the Bass Boost Circuit via the button on the front panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIGHLY DURABLE AND PORTABLE DESIGN WITH A VARIETY OF CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS\n\n\nThe FiiO E10K-TC is compact, portable and more durable than ever before, thanks to its brushed aluminium shell and chassis that allow for portable operation without worry.

When a USB connection is detected the BTR5 2021, it will automatically prompt you to turn on \"USB Audio Adapter\" mode, which turns off charging to the BTR5 2021 and allows you to use it as an audio dongle for your phone or other devices. Please press any button in 15s when the prompt menu jumps out. If there is no operation within 15 seconds, the charging function will stay on. (The pop-up menu can also be closed through the FiiO Control App.) 4. A short skin-friendly silicone Type-C to Type-C cable is added to the accessory list. 5. The package box is newly designed in a science fiction style, and the back panel adds an MQA logo. 6. The software filters have been reduced from 6 to 2 (since the DAC has added MQA support, we canceled the internal filter).\n\nHow to use the BTR5 2021 as a USB DAC for mobile phones?\n\n1. At present, most mobile phones on the market can support the FiiO music App, but the USB audio standard of various phone brands is not uniform, so we cannot guarantee full compatibility. 2. The BTR5 2021 supports a switch to \"USB Audio Adapter Mode\" by just one press. When a USB connection is detected the BTR5 2021, it will automatically prompt you to turn on \"USB Audio Adapter\" mode. At this time, just press any button so that it will turn off the charging function and enter the \"USB Audio Adapter Mode\".\n\nHow to use the car mode?\n\nAfter turning on the car mode, you can connect the BTR5 2021 to the on-board USB port, and the BTR5 2021 will power on automatically when the vehicle engine starts, and power off when the engine stops.\n\nHow to clear the pairing record on BTR5 2021?\n\nHold the Volume'+' and Volume'-' buttons at the same time for about 5s when the BTR5 2021 is powered on.\n\nHow to pair the BTR5 2021 with a smartphone via NFC? Why is the NFC function not so sensitive sometimes?\n\nEnsure the mobile phone supports NFC. Turn on the BTR5 2021 and unlock the phone. Put the NFC area of the BTR5 2021 close to that of the phone (usually there will be a dialogue popping up or a prompt tone). NFC is a near field communication technology. The NFC sensing area of the mobile phone and the BTR5 2021 must be closer enough to each other to be paired. In addition, the NFC power of different mobile phones is different (mobile phones with a metal shell have relatively low NFC sensitivity). In addition, a mobile phone wearing a phone case also has low NFC sensitivity, so it is suggested to remove the case and try again.\n\nIs there a delay for its Bluetooth? How long will it be?\n\nCurrently, any Bluetooth device will have a delay. But there is no obvious influence when listening to music. The time of delay is different for different Bluetooth codecs. The BTR5 2021 supports aptX LL (less than 40ms delay). For other Bluetooth codecs, the delay is about 100ms.\n\nDoes the BTR5 2021 support standby mode? \n\nYes. When it's connected successfully yet without playback and operation, it will enter standby mode (low power consumption). When it's not connected, it will turn off automatically after 2 minutes if there is no operation. (the auto-timer can be set on the App). The battery life is about 300 hours under standby mode.\n\nWhat's the material for the BTR5 2021?\n\nThe BTR5 2021's middle frame is made of aluminum alloy, with a 6H hardness 2.5D tempered glass on both the front and back panel (scratch resistance is the same as that of iPhone's), which is not easy to scratch in use. But please don't put it together with sharp metal objects like keys. Besides, the back clip is made of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene).\n\nWhat are the accessories for the BTR5 2021?\n\n-BTR5 2021 Standard Edition: Type-C to Type-C short cable, back clip, user manual, warranty card, Bluetooth instructions. -BTR5 2021 Apple Edition: except for those included in the standard edition, there is an extra Type-C to Lightning cable.\n\nWhat to do if the BTR5 2021 is frozen?\n\nIf the BTR5 2021 is frozen, please try to hold the Power button for at least 10 seconds to reset it.\n\nDoes the BTR5 2021 support LHDC/HWA? \n\nNo. Ever since the HWA was launched, its sound quality has been recognized by many users in China. The FiiO BTR3, as the earliest product on the market that perfectly supports HWA, was very popular. However, it has encountered some problems that we could not solve temporarily. For example: 1. HWA, as the latest technology, has more poor connection reliability than LDAC and aptX. 2. There were few devices that support HWA, especially consumers in foreign countries. Most of them have no idea about the HWA. 3. The internal ROM capacity of the CSR8675 is limited, especially after an upgrade to Bluetooth 5.0. The BLE function (App control) will take up more space. While coupled with the HWA algorithm, it will have more limited ROM capacity, and will restrict us to make improvements and expansion for the product functions. This is the main reason. 4. As the owner of HWA, Huawei also stated that HWA will face a large upgrade, and the upgraded HWA will no longer be compatible with the previous version. So Huawei themselves also canceled HWA support on their latest system.\n\nHow about the Bluetooth distance and signal strength? \n\nPlease refer to the Bluetooth instruction card inside the package. The BTR5 2021 supports high-rate and high-quality signal transmission, but the transmission distance will be shorter when transmitting high-quality signals. We have also compared similar devices of other brands. It turned out that the BTR5 2021 was excellent.\n\nDoes the BTR5 2021 support the headphones' remote control and a microphone?\n\nThe BTR5 2021 supports headphones of CTIA standard for remote control and microphone. But OMTP headphones can only listen to music.\n\n\nDOWNLOADS\nBTR5 2021 User Manual\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this FiiO BTR5 2021 comes with a 1 year warranty from FiiO that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about FiiO's warranty in India.\n\n\n\n\n",

The PEE51 features two Cirrus Logic CS43198 MasterHIFI DACs that support Hi-Res audio playback including native DSD256 and 32bit / 384kHz.\n\n\n\n\n\nINDIGENOUSLY DEVELOPED AUDIO CIRCUIT FOR STABLE AND UNRIVALLED PERFORMANCE\n\n\nPutting years of experience to best use, Astell&Kern has designed a highly intricate circuit on a small and 6-layered 14 x 41 mm printed circuit board (PCB). Even the micro resistors and tantalum capacitors used in the PEE51 were indigenously developed by Astell&Kern. These are the same capacitors that are used in the A&K DAPs and they optimise audio circuits to minimize fluctuations leading to overall stability and unrivalled sound quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nAN INDEPENDENT ANALOG AMPLIFIER TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY COLOURZATION & DISTORTION\n\n\nThe power of CS43198 DACs is combined with an independent analogue amplifier to deliver highly authentic sound reproduction. This allows you to enjoy a dynamic and clear sound that is free of colourisation and distortion just the way artists intend their music to sound. The PEE51 is compact and drives even high impedance headphones easily with an output level of 2 Vrms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY ASTELL&KERN SOUND SIGNATURE ON YOUR ANDROID SMARTPHONES AND COMPUTERS\n\n\nOffering the widely used USB-C connector, the Astell&Kern PEE51 is compatible with almost all the latest Android smartphones, tablets, Windows 10 computers and macOS. You can connect headphones to the PEE51 with a 3.5 mm connector. The PEE51 lets you discover the popular Astell&Kern sound signature using your audio devices. From full-size headsets to in-ears, you connect a host of headphones that support 3.5mm 3-pole and 4-pole plugs. Kindly note that 4-pole earbuds with inline controller and microphone functions are not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nROBUST 4-CORE SILVER-PLATED COPPER CABLE FOR NOISE-FREE SOUND REPRODUCTION\n\n\nEmpowered with a custom 4-core cable for precise sound reproduction, the PEE51 improves disconnect resistance. With reinforced aramid fibre, the PEE51 can resist a tensile force of up to 200 Newton. This thick cable consists of spiralled silver-plated copper wires wrapped around a centre Technora Aramid core to eliminate external noise. This copper wire also helps to deliver clean and rich surround sound. There is unique shielding on these cables that eliminates distortion and noise in digital and analogue signals coming from the playback device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"LIGHT AND SHADOW\" THEMED ELEGANT DESIGN THAT BALANCES BEAUTY AND COMFORT\n\n\nFeaturing the \"light and shadow\" design, the USB-C DUAL DAC utilises a unique design that has been fundamental to Astell&Kern products. This design consists of a single centerline that crosses from right to left. The ratio of the angles is optimised to ensure that the sharp portions of the four top faces coincide at a single point. Reflection on each side of the design follows the movement of light. The surface is polished to make one-hand use more comfortable. Reflecting on the durability of other Astell&Kern machines, the PEE51 uses robust metal elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nKINDLY READ THROUGH THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FOR BEST USER EXPERIENCE\n\n\nConsidering limitations of hardware, software and the overall system some of the devices might not be able to function perfectly with the Astell&Kern PEE51. iOS devices like iPhones and iPads are not compatible with the PEE51 currently while some Android devices may need changes in settings to work efficiently. If you are using the PEE51 with a computer, the computer will automatically install the required driver. However, a separate installation may be required for high-end audio playback. This extra installation file can be accessed from the Support-Download section of the Astell&Kern global website. Kindly note that to play hi-res audio files like DSD and PCM on your smartphones you will need a separate free / paid application that is compatible with high-definition audio playback. It is advised to get the volume level checked before connecting headphones to the PEE51 as there are chances of some devices having maximum volume by default. When you are using the PEE51 with an Astell&Kern player as an external D / A converter the volume will be set to the highest, by default. Listening to music on high volumes can damage your listening. Astell&Kern does not recommend using the PEE51 with Astell&Kern players. Firmware updates may be available from time to time to enhance stability and performance. Visit the Support-Download section of the Astell&Kern global site to get more information on updates and to check if any update is available.\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL SPECIFICATION\n\n\n\nHOUSING MATERIAL\nZinc alloy\n\n\nHOUSING COLOR\nTitan\n\n\nDAC\n Cirrus Logic CS43198 x 2\n\n\nSAMPLING FREQUENCY\nPCM: Supports up to 32bit / 384kHz / DSD Native: DSD64 (1bit 2.8MHz), Stereo / DSD128 (1bit 5.6MHz), Stereo / DSD256 (1bit 11.2MHz), Stereo\n\n\nINPUTS\nUSB Type-C (for Windows 10, Android Smartphone & Tablet PC, macOS)(Not compatible with iPhones and iPad)\n\n\nOUTPUTS\n3.5mm headphone\n\n\nAC SPARK INSULATION\nUSB Plug: 17mm [W] x 50mm [H] x 10.3mm [D] / 3.5mm  Headphone: 12mm [W] x 20mm [H] x 8.2mm [D]\n\n\nWEIGHT\napprox. 25 g\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO PARAMETERS\n\n\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n± 0.030 (Condition: 20Hz ~ 20kHz)\n\n\nSIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO\n118dB @ 1kHz, unbalanced\n\n\nTHD + N\n0.0004% @ 1kHz, unbalanced\n\n\nIMD SMPTE\n0.0003% 800Hz 10kHz (4: 1), unbalanced\n\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n2 Ohm\n\n\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n2 Vrms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

If you are a fan of vocals and pop music the vacuum tube will help you get the best sound. The N3Pro features Dual Operation Mode - Triode and Ultra Linear. With these options, you get to change the sound signature and output power which helps you to optimise the sound for a better music listening experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE DUAL OPERATION MODE: TRIODE MODE & ULTRA-LINEAR MODE\n\n\nPersonalise the sound the way you want to with the Dual Operation Mode. Under the Triode Mode, enjoy elegant and rich soundstage with focused imaging, emphasised mid-range frequencies and it is ideal for string and vocal-centric music. On the other hand, the Ultra-Linear Mode makes your music sound more lively, clear and impactful. You get to enjoy a better sense of depth, space and soundstage. This mode is ideal for instrumentals and for songs that need more punch, dynamics and control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWITH VINTAGE MILITARY MINIATURE TUBE\n\n\nThe Dual Operation Mode: Triode Mode & Ultra-Linear Mode requires a low power consumption and a warm pentode tube. Therefore Cayin N3Pro is integrated with Dual Raytheon JAN6418. This was originally used with military communication applications and was a part of premium Condenser microphones owing to its warm classic tube sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nHIGH SUSPENSION EFFECT AND SHOCK TREATMENT\n\n\nThe vibrating filament is disturbing and to address this the tubes are installed inside a custom made silicone case. The suspension effect is highly improved with the integration of flexible PCB. You can listen to music on Cayin N3Pro even when it is inside the backpack with low detrimental effects. This is the result of months of trails and redesigns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFEATURING DUAL DAC AND CUSTOM MADE LITHIUM BATTERY\n\n\nThe Cayin N3Pro comes with dual AKM AK4493EQ DAC chipsets which can decode up to DSD256 and 32 Bit/384kHz along with excellent dynamic range and resolution. You can enjoy improved dynamic range, signal to noise ratio and channel separation with mono mode. Enjoy extended hours of battery life with a custom made Lithium battery and power management system. Enjoy 11 hours of playback with 3.5mm phone (solid state), 9 hours of music time with 3.5m phone (Vaccum tube) and 9 hours of playtime with 4.4mm phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFULLY BALANCED DESIGN WITH 800MW HEADPHONE OUTPUT\n\n\nThe N3Pro delivers hot and cold signal streams similarly but not the polarity. They have to go through LPF and headphone amplifiers in parallel. While L+, L-, R+ and R- are delivered separately, common-mode noise will be reduced to nothing and cross talk will be decreased. Notably, the difference in the headphone amp output and hot and cold signals will have a huge impact on the output power and channel separation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE HI-RES WIRELESS SOUND AND STREAMING SERVICES\n\n\nYou can easily connect the Cayin M3Pro to Bluetooth headphones and speakers and enjoy Hi-Res Wireless music with duplex Bluetooth 5.0. Enjoy music streaming services like Tidal, Qobuz on your mobile phone. Listen to your songs on N3Pro with UAT, LDAC and AAC. You can multi-connectivity options including the 4.4mm BAL, 3.5mm SE Phone Out, 3.5mm SE Line Out (Dedicated), Two ways USB audio (DAC and Transport) S/PDIF Out (Embedded) 4.4mm BAL line Out (shared).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT CAYIN N3PRO WITH MOBILE DEVICES WITH HIBYLINK\n\n\nManage volume, music library, playback and create playlists with HiByMusic App. You can use this app to connect Cayi N3Pro to your mobile devices. You can use WiFi to get OTA software updates for your Cayin N3Pro. You can even transfer files wirelessly using Cayin N3pro. It supports a TF card of up to 1TB and you can connect it to a USB storage using a Type C connector. The multicolour smart glowing LED on the N3Pro denotes sample rate while playback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUSTOM DESIGNED INTERFACE AND INITIATIVE CONTROLS\n\n\nCayin N3Pro comes with 3.2 inches IPS touch screen along with 480 x 360 LG panel, great viewing angle, high contrast text and image display. Controlling the player is all easy with knobs, buttons and the touch screen interface. This player can playback all popular music file formats including the SACD-ISO.

The same is reflected in the A&norma SR25 MKII, which has undergone a complete upgrade in design and audio architecture to deliver life-like audio. The SR25 MKII features an updated Quad-core CPU along with the Cirrus Logic CS43198 Dual-DAC chip. It also extends native playback support for DSD256 and adds compatibility for MQA and LDAC protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPGRADED AUDIO ARCHITECTURE OFFERS ULTRA HIGH-RESOLUTION SOUND\n\n\nThe all-new Astell&Kern A&norma SR25 MKII delivers improved performance across the board compared to the SR25, including bass response, dynamic range, soundstage and imaging. The SR25 MKII utilises Astell&Kern's latest audio design technology for Bit-to-Bit playback with resolution up to 32bit/384 kHz. Native DSD audio is available up to 11.2 MHz, along with LDAC in addition to Qualcomm® aptX™ HD support resulting in true audiophile sound quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFULL 8X MQA DECODING FUSED WITH BALANCED OUTPUT FOR CLEAN AUDIO\n\n\nThe Astell&Kern SR25 MKII comes with Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) support. MQA authentication is a badge of approval, guaranteeing players master-quality audio output. The device can perform 8x decoding of MQA files to deliver outstanding sound quality. To further enhance the signal path, the SR25 MKII now comes with 2.5mm, 3.5mm and 4.4mm output options allowing you to connect to various devices. These connectivity options allow you to enjoy your music without worrying about adaptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY MUSIC WIRELESSLY WITH BT SINK AND SHARE FILES VIA AK FILE DROP\n\n\nThe Astell&Kern A&norma SR25 MKII comes with the newly introduced BT Sink function. This feature allows you to connect the SR25 MKII to an external device via Bluetooth, similar to connecting a smartphone with a BT speaker. Music from an external device, such as a smartphone can now be played back in high-quality on the SR25 MKII using the BT Sink function. SR25 MKII also comes with the new AK File Drop function, making file transfers easier and more convenient. Using AK File Drop, you can freely transfer files wirelessly through a PC, smartphone, or FTP program located on the same network. Music file management is now possible with a wireless solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFERING 20+ HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE WITH REPLAY GAIN FUNCTION\n\n\nThe Astell&Kern SR25 MKII can offer a playback time of up to 20 hours with one full charge, thanks to its optimised, energy-efficient circuitry. Enjoy your music anytime, anywhere with the SR25 MKII’s extended playback time and its portability. No need to worry about battery life. The SR25 MKII also comes embedded with ReplayGain, which adjusts the volume level of different sources to a uniform level. This feature is thoughtful and allows to maintain stable volume levels regardless of the device connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETELY REDESIGNED CHASSIS TO DELIVER ARTEFACT FREE AUDIO\n\n\nAstell&Kern A&norma SR25 MKII comes with a redesigned chassis. The top and bottom edges of the bezel are angled, giving the impression of a smaller rectangle floating freely inside the chassis. The pattern on the side is designed to draw attention to the volume wheel. This redesigned chassis is made of aluminium and features noise and electromagnetic shield cans to reduce interference with the audio signal. This design is further enhanced by applying a highly conductive, hyper-pure silver plating on the shield cans for superior shielding that provides excellent audio performance.\n\n\n\nSPECS\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nMODEL\nSR25 MKII\n\n\nBODY COLOR\nMercury D.
