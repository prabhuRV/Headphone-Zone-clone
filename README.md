Headphones are so much more than just a gadget. It is an access to your favorite soundtrack, your inner silence and exhilarating experiences that bring your favourite artist to life. Likewise weâ€™re not just a company. We are passionate music fanatics, discerning audiophiles, out of the box thinkers, entrepreneurs, risk takers and innovators.

Founded back in 2011, weâ€™ve seen 10 successful years, so we probably can't call ourselves a startup anymore. But, Headphone Zone really is run exactly like a start-up, where decisions are quick, hierarchy is flat, roles aren't defined and responsibilities are spread like a buffet table. Weâ€™re really proud of our young culture that is as much about fun and learning as it is about working extremely hard and excelling in todayâ€™s fast-emerging e-commerce space.

If you are any of the above and would like to channel all that passion into a career and watch yourself grow, Headphone Zone is just the place for you. We hire zealous people, who are not just music lovers but also creative and hardworking. At Headphone Zone you have the opportunity to showcase your talents, identify your strengths and channel your desire to learn in the right direction

# End Notes  ðŸ“‘
In this project we have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

# Limitations 

All pages are not responsive yet, pages are not properly visible on small screen devices as we were having only 6 days to complete the project.
